Three of a kind. Lets do this. Thats it? Three guys? Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty. Six shares. Dont forget the guy who planned the job. He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice? I know why they call him the Joker. So why do they call him the Joker? I heard he wears makeup. Makeup? Yeah! to scare people. You know, war paint? Alright everybody, hands up heads down! I said, hands up, heads down! Lets go pal! Im making a withdrawal here. Put your hands up! Here comes the silent alarm. There it goes. Heads down! Get down. I said stay down there! Thats funny it didnt dial out to 911. I was trying to reach a private number. Is it a problem? No, Im done here ... Obviously we dont want you doing anything with your hands other than holding on for dear life. On the ground! Stay on the ground! Nobody make a move! Nobody! Stay down! Come here! Do you have any idea who youre stealing from? You and your friends are dead! Hes out, right? Where did you learn to count? They wired this thing up with like 5000 Voltz. What kind of bank does that? A mob bank. I guess the Joker is as crazy as they say. Where is the alarm guy? The boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out. One less share, right? Funny ... He told me something similar. He what? No, no! Thats a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so smart hed had us bring a bigger car. Im betting the Joker told you to kill me as soon as we loaded the cash. No, no, no, no ... I kill the bus driver. Bus driver? What bus driver? Schools out. Time to go. Cats not getting up, is he? Thats a lot of money. What happened to the rest of the guys? You think youre smart, huh? Well, the guy that hired you will just do the same with you. Ah, criminals in this town used to believe in things. Honor, respect! Look at you! What do you believe in? Huh, what do you believe in? I believe whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you... stranger. Mr. Mayor, you were elected in the campaign to clean up the city. When are you going to start? Well, Mike, I believe I already have. Like the socalled Batman? Were hearing that hes doing some good. That criminals are running scared. But I say ... Naw, man... I dont like it tonight. What!, are you superstitious? You got more chance of winning the powerball than running into him. That simply is not true. Im told that Our men in the major crimes unit are close to ... Mayor says youre closing in on the Batman. The investigation is ongoing. Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant? I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective? Checked her back into the hospital. Sorry. So he hasnt shown up? I hope he doesnt. I like reminding everybody that hes out there. Why wouldnt he come? Hopefully because he is busy. Thats why we bring dogs. Hey, my filhotinhos. Look what your drugs did to my customers. Buyer beware. I told you my compound would take you places. I never said theyd be places you wanted to go. My business repeat customers. If you dont like what I have to offer you can buy from someone else. Assuming Batman left anyone to buy from... My dogs are hungry! Pity there is only one of you. Thats not him. Thats more like it. LOITER INTIMIDATE Dont let me find you out here again. We are trying to help you. I dont need help! Not my diagnosis. What gives you the right? Whats the difference between you and me? I am not wearing hockey pads. He cant resist showing us his face. Whats he hiding under that makeup? Can we get a minute, people, please? Him again? Where are the others? Another bunch of smalltimers. Some of the marked notes I gave you. My detectives have been making drug busts with them for weeks. This bank was another draft of the mob. That makes five. We found a bulk of the dirty cash. Time to move in. We would have to hit all banks simultaneously. Swat teams, backup. What about this Joker guy? One man or the entire mob? He can wait. When the new DA hears about this they want in. Do you trust him? Itd be hard to keep him out. I hear he is as stubborn as you are. It would be nice when Wayne manor is rebuilt. If you can swap not sleeping in a penthouse youre not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stich yourself up you do make a bloody mess. Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes. You ought to be pretty knowledgable by now. My armor. Carrying too much weight. I need to be faster. Im sure Mr. Fox can oblige. Did you get mauled by a tiger? It was a dog.  Ah?  It was a big dog. More copycats last night, Alfred. With guns. Why dont you hire them and take a weekend off? That wasnt ... exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people. I know. But things have improved. Look at the new district attorney. I am. Closely. I need to know if he can be trusted. Are you interested in his character or ... his sexual circle? Who Rachel spends her time with is her business. I trust you dont have me followed on my day off. If you ever took one I might. Know your limits, master Wayne. The Batman has no limits. But you do, sir. Well, I cant afford to know them. Whats going to happen on the day that you find out? We all know how much you like to say I told you so On that day, Master Wayne, even I wont want to. Probably. Sorry Im late, folks. Where were you? Worried youd have to step up? Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. Fairs fair. Heads, Ill take it. Tails, hes all yours. Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin to see who leads? Its my fathers lucky coin. As I recall, it got me my first date with you. You wouldnt leave something like that up to chance. I dont. I make my own luck. All rise! The Honorable Judge Surrillo presiding. I thought the DA just plays golf with the mayor or things like that. Teeoff is 130. More than enough time to put you away for life, Salli. With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have stepped up to run this socalled family. Is that man in this courtroom today? Could you identify him for us please? You win counselor. It was me! I have a sworn statement from you, that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family. Maroni? He is a fallguy! Im the brains of the organization. Order, order! Permission to treat the witness as hostile. Granted. Hostile? Ill show you hostile! Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.. Get him out of here! But, your honor, Im not done! We will never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we wont be able to charge him, but the fact they are trying to kill you, means we are getting to them. Well Im glad youre so pleased Rachel. And Im fine, by the way. Come on Harvey, you are Gothams DA! If you are not getting shot at youre not doing your job right. You know,he said if you were rattled you could take the rest of the day off. I cant, I dragged the Head of the major crimes unit down here. Jim Gordon? Hes a friend actually, try to be nice! I hear you got a hell of a right cross. Its a shame that Salvatores gone walk. Yeah, well good thing about the mob is They keep giving you second chances. Lightly radiated bills. Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help? We have links with various agents ... Save it Gordon, I want to meet him. Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on site. Uhum ... And what about that floodlight on the top of MCU? If youve got problems with malfunctioning equipment, I suggest you take them up with maintenance counselor. I put every known money launderer in Gotham, behind bars, but the Mob is still getting its money. I think you and your friend, have found the last game in town and are trying to hit them where it hurts their wallets. Thats bold. You gonna count me in? In this town the fewer people know something, the safer the operation. Gordon, I dont like that youve got your own special unit and I dont like that is full of cops I investigated at internal affairs. If I had to work with cops you investigated while you were licking your name at IIIP working alone. I dont get political points for being an idealist. I have to do the best I can with what I have. You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me what were after? Well, I can give you the names of the banks. Well, thats a start ... Ill get you your warrants, but I want your trust. You dont have to sell me Dent. We all know youre Gothams white knight. I heard they have a different name for me down at MCU. I wouldnt know about that. In China, Lau Security Investments stands for dynamic new growth. The joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse. Well, Mr Lau I speak for the rest of the board ... And Mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement. Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished But frankly ... This is embarrasing! You worry about the delegace Mr. Reese Ill worry about Bruce Wayne. Its done. The numbers are solid. Do them again. Wouldnt want the trust fund to run out, now would we? Another long night? This joint venture was your idea and the consultants love it. But I am not convinced. Laus company has grown by 8 anually like clockwork. His revenue stream must be off the books. It may be even illegal. OK cancel the deal. You already knew? I just needed a closer look at their books. Anything else you can trouble me for? I need a new suit. Yeah ... 3 buttons is a little I am not talking fashion Mr Fox, so much as function.  Want to be able to turn your head?  Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier. I will see what I can do. It took me 3 weeks to get a reservation here. And I had to tell them I work for the government. Really? This city health inspector is not afraid to pull strings. Rachel! Fancy that! Yeah Bruce, fancy that. Rachel, Natasha. Natasha, Rachel.  Natasha, are you the. ..  The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet. Wow, Harveys taking me next week. Really? So youre into ballet? Bruce, this is Harvey Dent. The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachels told me everything about you. Well, I certainly hope not. So, lets put a couple of tables together.  Im not sure that theyll let us.  Oh they should. I own the place. How could want to raise children in a city like this? Well, I was raised here I turned out OK. Is Wayne manor in the city limits? The Palisades. You know as our new DA, you might want to figure out where your jurisdiction ends. Im talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante. Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for whats right. Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials. And not a man who thinks hes above the law.  Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?  We did. All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city. But this is a democracy, Harvey. When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasnt considered an honor, it was considered a public service. Harvey, the last man that they appointed to protect the republic was named Caesar, and he never gave up his power. OK, fine. You either die a hero ... or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Look whoever the Batman is, he doesnt want to do this for the rest of his life. Batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.  Someone like you, Mr. Dent?  Maybe. If Im up to it.  What if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader?  If I were sneaking out every night, someone would have noticed by now. Well ... Im sold that Im going to throw you a fundraiser. Thats nice of you Bruce, but Im not up for reelection for 3 years. No, you dont understand. One fundraiser with my pals, youll never need another cent. What the hell is this? As you all are aware, one of our deposits was stolen. A relatively small amount. Who is stupid enough to steal from us? purple suit and makeup. Hes not the problem. Hes a nobody. The problem is our money being tracked by the cops. Thanks to Mr. Maronis well placed sources, we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills and are planning to seize your funds today. And since the enthusiastic new DA has put all my competitors out of business, Im your only option. So what do you propose? Moving all deposits to one secure location.  Not a bank.  Where then? Nobody can know, but me. If the police were to gain leverage over one of you, everyones money would be at stake. What stop them getting to you? I go to Hong Kong. Far from Dents jurisdiction And the Chinese will not extradite one of their own. How soon can we move the money? I already have. For obvious reasons, I couldnt wait for your permission. Rest assured your money is safe. And I thought my jokes were bad. Give me one reason why I shouldnt have my boy here pull your head off. How about a magic trick? Im going to make this pencil disappear. Tahdah! Its Gone! Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasnt cheap. You ought to know, you bought it! Easy. I want to hear the opposition. Lets wind the clock back a year. These cops and lawyers wouldnt dare cross any of you. What happened? Did your balls drop off?  You see a guy like me ...  A freak! A guy like me .. I know why you choose to have group therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why youre afraid to go out at night. The Batman. Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately. Dent, hes just the beginning. And as for the televisions socalled plan ... The Batman has no jurisdiction. Hell find him and make him squeal. I know the squealers when I see them.  What do you propose?  Its simple. We kill the Batman. If it is so simple why havent you done it already? If you are good thing at something, never do it for free. And what you want? Hm ... Half.  Are you crazy!  No Im not ... No, Im not. If we dont deal with this now, soon little Gamble here wont be able to get a nickel for his grandma. Enough from the clown! Lets not blow this out of proportion. Do you think you can steal from us and just walk away? Im putting a word out 500 grand for this clown dead. A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first. Alright, so listen. Why dont you give me a call when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously? Heres my card. Youre a hard man to reach. Lau is halfway to Hong Kong. If he had asked, I could have taken his passport. I told you to keep me in the loop. All that was left in the vaults were marked bills. They knew we were coming. As soon as your office got involved ... My office? Youre sitting down there with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and youre talking ... Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beef. Dont try and cloud the fact that clearly Maronis got people in your office, Dent. We need Lau back. But the Chinese wont extradite a National under any circumstances. If I get him to you, can you get him to talk? Ill get him to sing. Were going after the mobs life savings. Things will get ugly ... I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant. How will you get him back ... He does that. Our Chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off. Well Im sure youve always wanted to go to Hong Kong. Whats wrong with a phone call? I think Mr Lau deserves a more ... personal touch. Now for high altitude jumps, youre gonna need oxygen and stabilizers. But what about getting back into the plane? Id recommend a good travel agent. Without it landing. Now thats more like it, Mr. Wayne. The ClA had a program back in the 60s for getting their people out of hot spots called skyhook You could look into that. Okay, now. Hardened Kevlar plates over titaniumtipped triweaved fibers for flexibility. Youll be lighter, faster, more agile. Perhaps you should read the instructions first. Now there is a tradeoff. Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire. We wouldnt want to make things too easy now, would we? How will it hold up against dogs? We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas? It should do fine against cats. I found one in Arizona. An very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week and hed take the cash. What about a flight crew? South Korean smugglers they run flights into Pyongyang below radar the whole way. Did you think of an alibi? Oh, yes. Presentation cancelled I believe this is your plane, sir! You look tired, Alfred. Will you be all right without me? If you can tell me the Russian for Apply your own bloody suntan lotion. Yo Gamble, somebody here for you. They say theyve just killed the Joker. And they brought the body. Dead, thats 500 ... How about alive? You want to know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. One night he goes off crazier than usual Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He does not like that. Not one bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says Why so serious, son? He comes at me with the knife ... Why so serious, son? He sticks the blade in my mouth Lets put a smile on that face! Why so serious? Now, our operation is small but there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So, which of you fine gentleman would like to join our team? Theres only one spot open right now. So were going to have tryouts? Make it fast. Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox. Mr Lau regrets he isnt able to greet you in person today. I understand. For security purposes, Im going to have to ask you to check in your mobile. Of course I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations. This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force. I couldnt let such a thing threaten my company. Of course. A businessman of your stature will understand that with you here now, we can continue. Well I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style Mr Lau ...  We do not allow cell phones in here.  Oh sorry, forgot I had it. I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold. We cant afford to be seen to do business with ... whatever it is youre accused of being. Im sure a businessman of your stature will understand. I think Mr Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed. Mr. Wayne didnt want you to think that he was deliberately wasting your time. Just accidentally wasting it. Thats very good Mr Lau. Accidentally, very good. Hey, sir! A better view from the train.  Hows the view from LSl hallways?  Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.  What is this?  I had RND work it up. It sends out a high frequency pulse records in response time. For mapping an environment.  Sonar, just like a ...  a submarine, Mr. Wayne.  And the other device?  Its in place. Mr Wayne, good luck. Where are the police? They are coming. Then what the hell am I paying them for? Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon. Look, give us the money and well talk about making a deal. The money is the only reason I am still alive. Oh, you mean when they find out that youve helped us theyre going to kill you? Are you threatening my client? No, Im just assuming your clients cooperation with this investigation. As well everyone. No? Okay. Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau. Wait. I wont give you the money. But I will give you my clients. All of them. You were a glorified accountant. What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge? Im good with calculation. I handled all the investments. One big pot.  Got it.  One minute. If they pull their money we can charge them all as one crew on conspiracy. Charge them with what? In a Reiko case, if you can charge one of the conspirators with a felony, you can ... Charge all of them with it. Thats great. Mr Lau. What kind of details do you have about this communal fund? Edgers, notebooks ... Immunity, protection and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong. After you testify in open court. And Im just curious. with all your clients locked up, whats going to happen with all that money? Like I said, I am good with calculation. He cant go to county, Ill keep him here in the holding cells. What is this Gordon, your fortress?  Do you trust them over at county?  I dont trust them here. Lau stays. Well, I dont know about Mr. Laus travel arrangements, but Im sure glad hes back. He would, we should have hired the clown. He was right, we have to fix real problem. Batman. Im not aware of any participation by the Batman in the investigations. Our boy looks good on the tube You sure you want to embarrass me in front of my friends lieutenant? No, dont worry. Theyre coming too. Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall. How do the defendants plead? Order in court. convince Surrillo to hear this farce? She shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all she is a Judge. Even if you blow enough smoke to get convinctions out of Surrillo, youre going to set a new record in appeals for quickest tick in the ass. It wont matter, the head guys make bail, sure. But the midlevel guys, they cant. They cant afford to be off the streets long enough for trial and appeal, theyll cut deals that include some jailtime. Think of all you can do with 18 months of clean streets. Mr. Mayor, you cant ... Get out, both of you. Sit down. The public likes you. Thats the only reason that this might fly. But that means its on you. They are all going to come after you now and not just the mob. Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone whose wallet is about to get lighter. Are you up to it? You better be, because if they get anything on you and those criminals are back on the streets ... Followed swiftly by you and me. I think your fundraiser will be a great success sir. And why do you think I want to hold a party for Harvey Dent? Well, I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself and the scum of Gothams underbelly. To try to impress Miss Dawes. Very droll, but very wrong. Actually its Dent. The police disclosed the footage found at scene of the body. Sensitive viewers please be aware the image is disturbing.  Tell them your name.  Brian.  Are you the real Batman?  No! No! Then why do you dress up like him?  Hes a symbol... that we dont have to be afraid of scum like you!  Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do! So you think Batman has made Gotham a better place? You see this is how crazy Batman has made Gotham. If you want to order in Gotham the Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in! And every day he doesnt, people will die! Starting tonight. Im a man of my word. Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld, scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.  Ill be back.  Rachel! A little liquid courage, Mr Dent?  Alfred, right?  Thats right, sir. Rachel talks about you all the time. Youve known her for her whole life? Not yet, sir. Any psychotic exboyfriends I should be aware of? Oh, you have no idea! Im sorry that Im late, but Im glad to see that you all got started without me. Now, where is Harvey? Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour! And wheres Rachel Dawes, she is my oldest friend. Come here. When Rachel first told me that she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent?  Yeah nice slogan, Harvey. But you caught Rachels attention. Then I started to pay attention to Harvey and all that hes been doing as our new DA. And you know what? I believe in Harvey Dent. I believe that on his watch Gotham can feel a little safer. A little more optimistic. Look at this face. This is the face of Gothams bright future. To Harvey Dent. Lets hear it for him. Harvey may not know you well enough to understand when you are making fun of him. but I do. No, I meant every word. You know that day that you once told me about when Gotham would no longer need Batman?  Its coming.  Bruce ...  You cant ask me to wait for that.  Its happening now. Harvey is that hero. He locked up half of the citys criminals and he did it without wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero with a face. You throw a party Wayne, Ill give you that. Thanks again. You mind if I borrow Rachel? Lieutenant, that Joker card pinned to the body? Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.  Any matches?  All three. The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb. The Joker is telling us who hes targeting. Get a unit over to Surrillos house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent. Get them both into protective custody. Wheres the commissioner? City Hall. Seal the building. No one in or out until I get there. Got it.  Gordon! What are you up to?  Were secure. I want a floor by floor search of the entire building. Sorry sir, we believe the Joker has made a threat against your life. These are dangerous people, Judge. Yes, but youre not giving me an awful lot of information.  Even we dont know where youre going.  Take the envelope. Get in, open it. Itll tell you where youre headed. You can not leave me alone with these people. The whole mob is after you and youre worried about these guys? Compared to this, the mob doesnt scare me. Gordon, youre unlikely to discover this for yourself, so.. Take my word, the Police Commissioner theres a lot of threats. I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago. Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly. Yeah, I bet. Yeah, it makes you think about things you couldnt stand losing. About who you want to spend the rest of your life with. Its a pretty big commitment. Well, not if the Mob has their way. Itd be good to explain to my wife why Im late for dinner tonight. Sir, the Joker card had traces of your DNA on it.  Dont do that.  Alright. Lets be serious then.  Okay.  Whats your answer? I dont have an answer. Howd they get my DNA? Somebody with access to your office or your house must have lifted a tissue or a glass... Wait!  I guess the answer is no.  Harvey ...  Its someone else, isnt it?  Harvey! Just tell me its not Wayne, the guys a complete What are you doing? Get a medic! We made it! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are tonights entertainment! I only have one question. Where is Harvey Dent? You know where Harvey is? You know who he is? Hands up, pretty boy! Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him about something, something little. No. ..  Whats going on out there?  Wayne! Ah, thank God youve got a panic room. Wait! You got to be kidding me.  You know, Ill settle for his loved ones.  Were not intimidated by thugs! You know, you remind me of my father.  I hated my father!  Okay stop! Well, hello beautiful! You must be Harveys squeeze! And you are beautiful. You look nervous. Is it the scars? You want to know how I got them? Come here. Hey! Look at me. So I had a wife, beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much. Who tells me I ought to smile more. Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks One day, they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She cant take it. I just want to see her smile again, hmm? I just want her to know that I dont care about the scars. So... I stick a razor in my mouth and do this... to myself And you know what? She cant stand the sight of me! She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now Im always smiling! A little fight in you. I like that. Then youre going to love me.  Drop the gun.  Oh, sure! You just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are.  Let her go.  Very poor choice of words! Are you alright? Lets not do that again ...  Is Harvey okay?  Hes safe. Thank you Jim, its over! As long as they dont get to Lau, weve cut off their funds. But the prosecution is over! Nobodys standing up in front of a judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away. What about Dent? If hes got any sense, Dents halfway to Mexico. So where do you keep your trash? Youre due at court. I need you alive long enough to get you under record. You cant protect me. You cant even protect yourselves. If you refuse to cooperate youre not coming back here, you go to county. How long you calculate youll last in there? Targeting me wont get their money back. I knew the mob wouldnt go down without a fight, but this is different.  Theyve crossed the line.  Youve crossed the line first,sir You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation. In their desperation, they turned to a man they didnt fully understand. Criminals arent complicated Alfred. We just need to figure out what hes after. With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this is a man you dont fully understand either. A long time ago I was in Burma. My friends and I were working for the local government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit. So, we went looking for the stones. But in 6 months we never met anyone who traded with him. One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine.  The bandit had been throwing them away.  So why steal them? Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because some men arent looking for anything logical, like money. They cant be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn. Get the names.  Richard Dent  Patrick Harvey Harvey Dent. I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it. Us contaminate it? Its because of you these guys are dead ... Detective! Just a minute guys. Its brick underneath. You going to take ballistics off a shattered bullet? No. Fingerprints. Obituaries. Mayor Anthony Garcia. Whatever youre going to do, do it fast. Because we found his next target. Hes put it in tomorrows paper. Im not sure you made it loud enough, sir. What can I do for you Mr Reese? You wanted me to do the diligence on the LSI holdings deal again.  Well, I found some irregularities.  Our CEO is in police custody. No, not with their numbers With yours. Applied sciences. A whole division of Wayne Enterprises just disappeared, overnight. I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files. Dont tell me you didnt recognize your baby out there pancaking cop cars on the evening news. Now you got the entire RND department burning through cash claiming its related to cellphones for the army? What are you building for him now, a rocket ship? I want 10 million dollars a year for the rest of my life. Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante, who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp ... ... with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck. Keep that. This is your original scan. Here it is reengineered. And theres the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip. Ill get you a copy. Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND? Yes, government telecommunications project. I wasnt aware we had any government contracts. Lucius, Im playing this one pretty close to the chest. Fair enough. With no word from the Batman. Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb. These cops have to be wondering if the Joker will make good on his threat in the obituary column of the Gotham Times to kill the mayor. Ive checked all the databases. There are four possibles. Cross reference the addresses. Look for Park Side, overlooking the parade. I got one! Melvin White, Aggravated his soul, moved to Arkham twice. How many you got on the roof? Were tight but frankly theres a lot of windows up here! Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement and to the protection of his community. I remember when I first took office, I asked him if he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and... Clearly he was not a man who minced words nor should he have been A number of policies that he enacted were unpopular. Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letter ...  Who is it?  What happened? They took our guns and uniforms. We must remember that vigilance is the price of safety. Standby, Honor, Guard, Attenhut. Ready Aim Fire! Ready, aim ... Ready, aim ... Get him out!  Ill see you later!  Why are you coming back? Get out! Tell me what you know about the Joker.  No!  Im sorry Barbara. Junior, go play with your sister, go ahead. If there is anything that I can do, were here for you. Are you happy ..Are you You brought this craziness on us ... You did! Switch it off, he aint coming. He doesnt want to talk to us. May God help whoever he does want to talk to. Can we go some place quieter? We cant hear each other talk. Why makes you think I want to hear you talk? What?  Harvey, where are you?  Where are you? Im where you should be at MCU Im trying to deal with all this mess. Can I get the fingerprint analysis? Rachel, listen to me. Youre not safe there.  Oh, this is Gordons unit.  Gordons gone, Rachel.  He vouched for these men.  And hes gone. The Joker has named you next. Is there anyone in this town we can trust? Bruce. We can trust Bruce Wayne. No Rachel, I know youre his friend but ... Harvey, Trust me. Bruces penthouse is now the safest place in the city. Then you go straight there. Dont tell anybody where youre going. Ill find you there. I love you. I want the Joker. From one professional to another, if youre trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot. From this height, the fall wouldnt kill me. Im counting on it. Where is he? I dont know where he is. He found us.  He must have friends.  Friends? Have you met this guy?  Someone knows where he is!  Nobodys going to tell you nothing. He was right. You got rules. The Joker... Hes got no rules. Nobodys going to cross him for you. If you want this guy, you got one way. But you already know what that is. Just take off that mask let him come find you. Or are you going to let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind. You want to play games? Hows that feel?  Dont kill ...  I wouldnt? You dont think I will? You dont think I will? No, I wouldnt. Thats why Im not going to leave it up to me. Heads, you get to keep your head. Tails, not so lucky. So, you want to tell me about the Joker?  Lets go again.  I dont know anything, I dont! Youre not playing the odds, friend. Lets do it again.  Youd leave a mans life to chance?  Not exactly. His name is Shif, Thomas. Hes a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham. The kind of mind that Joker attracts. What do you expect to learn from him? The Joker killed Gordon. Hes going to kill Rachel! You are the symbol of hope I could never be. Your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades. If anyone saw this, everything would be undone. All the criminals you pulled off the streets would be released and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.  Youre going to hold a press conference tomorrow morning.  Why? No one else will die because of me. Gotham is in your hands now. You cant. You cant give in. You cant give in! Harvey called. He said Batmans going to turn himself in. I have no choice. Do you honestly think thats going to keep the Joker from killing people? Maybe not, but I have enough blood on my hands. I have seen now what I would have to become to stop a man like him. You once told me that if the day came when I... was finished, then we would be together. Bruce, dont make me your one hope for a normal life. Did you mean it? Yes. If you turn yourself in, theyre not going to let us be together.  Logs as well?  Everything. Anything that can lead back to Lucius or Rachel. People are dying Alfred. What would you have me do?  Endure ... master Wayne.  Take it .... Theyll hate you for it. But thats the point of Batman, he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make, the right choice. Well today I found out what Batman cant do. He cant endure this. Today you get to say I told you so. Today, I dont want to. But I did bloody tell you. I suppose theyll lock me up as well. As your accomplice... Accomplice? Im going to tell them the whole thing was your idea. Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for coming. Ive called this press conference for two reasons. Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done. Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in. But first, lets consider the situation. Should we give into this terrorists demands?  Do we really think that ...  Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante ... than the lives of citizens? The Batman is an outlaw. But thats not why were demanding he turn himself in. Were doing it because were scared. Weve been happy to let the Batman clean up our streets for us until now. Things are worse than ever! Yes they are ... But the night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you ... the dawn is coming. One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws hes broken. But to us, not to this madman! No more dead cops! He should turn himself in! So be it. Take the Batman into custody. I am the Batman. Alfred! Why is he letting Harvey do this?  He went down to the press conference.  I know, and he just stoodby! Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent believe the Batman stands for something more important than the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes. Even if everyone hates him for it. Thats a sacrifice hes making. Hes not being a hero. He is being something more. Yeah, youre absolutely right. Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.  You know him better than anyone.  I do. Will you give this to him for me? When the time is right.  How will I know?  Its not sealed.  Bye Alfred.  Goodbye Rachel. Sorry, I didnt have time to talk this through with you ... What are you doing? Theyre transferring me to Central holding. This is the Jokers chance. And when he attacks, the Batman will take him down. Listen to me, this is too dangerous! We get this guy to county, hes their problem. The streets will be cleared along your route. Lets go! Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason! I hope you got some moves pal. Hes using you as bait. He doesnt even know if he can get the Joker.  Hes failed so far.  How do you know what hes looking for? I just, I do! Anyway Harvey, this isnt just about you. What about all the people who are depending on you to clean the city up and to do it honorably? Harvey, tell everyone the truth. Heads, I go through with it. This is your life! You cant leave something like that to chance. Im not. You make your own luck. Hey! You wait like everyone else, pal. What the hell is that? Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead! Damn it! All units, divert down onto lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.  Exit down!  Lower 5th? Well be like turkeys on Thanksgiving down there. Come on. Get us out of here. Lets go Listen, we need backup. Weve got company. We got trouble, guys. Lock and load! What the hell was that? These things were built for that, right? Hes going to need something a lot bigger to get through this. What is that? What is that? A bazooka! I didnt sign up for this! Look out. Down! Come on! Lets go! Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent! Excuse me, I want to drive. Scanning all systems. Scanning all systems. We got to get topside. We need air support now. I like this job! I like it! Damage catastrophic. Eject sequence initiated. Goodbye. Were on point! Ready to give them some of their own medicine. Thats what Im talking about. Aircabs. Okay! Rack em up, rack em up, rack em up! Thats not good. Okay, Thats not good! Now there is the Batman. Oh, you want to play! Come on. Come on ... He missed! You cant stop here! Were like sitting ducks! Come on ... Come on ... I want you to do it. Come on! Hit me ... hit me! Hit me! Could you please just give me a minute? We got you, you son of a bitch. Gordon ... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest? We got him, Harvey. Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent! How does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham? No. Im no hero. Gothams finest, theyre the heroes. But you and your office have been working with the Batman all along? No. But I trusted him to do the right thing. Saving my ass. Alright people! Thats enough. Let him be. Thank you, detective. I got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend. Thank you, counselor. Stay away! All of you. I dont want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand? Back from the dead? I. .. I couldnt risk my familys safety. What do we got? Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental. Clothing is custom, no labels. Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint. No name, no other alias. Go home, Gordon. The clown will keep til morning. Go get some rest. Youre going to need it. Tomorrow you take the big job. You dont have any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon. Im sorry, I couldnt risk ...  Heads up big bastards!  I dont feel good... Youre a cop killer. Youre lucky to be feeling anything below the neck. Police! Stay away from the bars! My insides hurt. Did Batman save you, Daddy? Actually this time I saved him. Has he said anything yet? Evening ... Commissioner. Harvey Dent never made it home. Of course not. What have you done with him? Me? I was right here. Who did you leave him with? Your people? Thats assuming of course that they are still your people, and not Maronis. Does it depress you, commissioner? To know just how alone you really are? Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dents current predicament? Where is he? Whats the time? What difference does that make? Well, depending on the time, he may in one spot or several. If were gonna play games... Im gonna need a cup of coffee. Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine? Not exactly. Never start with the head, the victim gets all fuzzy. He cant feel ... See? You wanted me. Here I am. I wanted to see what you would do. And you didnt disappoint. You let five people die. Then you let Dent take your place.  Even to a guy like me, thats cold.  Wheres Dent? Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth. Theres no going back. Youve changed things ... Forever. Then why do you want to kill me? I dont want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no. No! You .. complete me. Youre garbage. You kill for money. Dont talk like one of them. Youre not! Even if youd like to be. To them youre just a freak. Like me. They need you right now. When they dont, theyll cast you out. See there are morals, your code ... its a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They are only as good as the world allows them to be. Ill show you. When the chips are down these civilized people, theyll eat each other. See, Im not a monster. Im just ahead of the curve. Wheres Dent? You have all these rules and you think theyll save you. Hes in control. I have one rule. Oh .. Then thats the rule youll have to break to know the truth. . Which is? The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. And tonight youre gonna break your one rule. Im considering it. No, theres only minutes left, so youre gonna have to play my little game if you want to save one of them. You know for a while there I thought you really were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her ... Look at you go? Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny? Where are they? Killing is making a choice. Where are they? Choose between one life or the other. Your friend, the DA, or his blushing bridetobe? You have nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength. Dont worry. Im gonna tell you where they are. Both of them. And thats the point. Youll have to choose. Hes at 250 52nd street. And shes on Avenue X, at Cicero.  Which one you going after?  Rachel. Were getting Dent! Hello! Can anybody hear me? Hello!  Rachel?  Harvey! Oh, Harvey! Thank God! Are you okay? Im alright. Im in a warehouse. Theyve got me wired to these oil drums. I am too. Harvey ... I want...I want my phone call. I want my phone call! I want my phone call. Thats nice. How many of your friends have I killed? Im a twenty year man. I know the difference between punks who need a little lesson in manners... and the freaks like you who just enjoy it. And youve killed six of my friends. Please. My insides hurt. I dont really care! Back away. The boss said that hed make the voices go away. He said hed go inside and replace them with bright lights. Like Christmas! Youre out of your mind, pal. Back off! Medic right away in the holding deck. Come on, get the door open. You guys back off! Listen, we dont have a lot of time. He told me that only one of us was going to make it. And that they were going to let our friends choose. Okay, Rachel. Its going to be fine. It going to be all right. Theyre coming for you. Okay. Ill help you. Talk me through with whats going on with you. Can find anything sharp? Im trying. What...Harvey? Harvey, whats happening? All available units. Converge to 250 52nd street. Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You cant savor all the little emotion. You see... In their last moments people show you who they really are. So, in a way I know your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?  Whats that?  Hes got some kind of a contusion. I know youre going to enjoy this. Im gonna have to try and enjoy it even more. Easy! Easy! Drop the weapon now! Let him go now! Drop the weapon!  Sorry.  What do you want? I just want my phone call. What ... Whats happening? Just talk to me for one second. Alright. Is that a ... phone? Mount the curb! Harvey ... just in case, I want to tell you something. Dont think like that, Rachel! Theyre coming for you. I know they are. But I dont want them to. I dont want to live without you and I do have an answer for you. My answer is yes. No! No! No! Not me. Why are you coming for me? No! Rachel! Rachel! Harvey ... Okay. Harvey, its okay. Its alright. Listen. Some ... No! Rachel! No! Hello there. Back at the MCU the Jokers gone. With Lau? The Joker planned to be caught. He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU. Dear Bruce. I need to be honest and clear. Im going to marry Harvey Dent. I love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. When I told you that if Gotham not longer needed Batman we could be together, I meant it. But now Im sure the day wont come when you no longer need Batman. I hope it does. And if it does, Ill be there. But as your friend. Im sorry, Harvey. Im sorry I let you down. If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people. Love, now and always, Rachel. I prepared a little breakfast. Very well, then ... Alfred. Yes, master Wayne. Should I bring this on her? I was meant to inspire good. Not madness, not death. You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gothams criminals. Didnt you think there might be some casualties? Things are always going to get worse before they get better. But Rachel, Alfred ... Rachel believed in what you stood for. What we stand for. Gotham needs you. No. Gotham needs its true hero. And I let that murdering psychopathic blow him half to hell. Which is why for now theyre going to have to make do with you. She was going to wait for me, Alfred. Dent doesnt know. He can never know.  Whats that?  It could wait. That bandit in the forest, in Burma. Did you catch him? Yes How? We burned the forest down. Hes a credible source. An MNA lawyer from a prestigious consultancy. He says hes waited as long as he can for the Batman to do the right thing. Now hes taking matters into his own hands. Well be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman. Im sorry about Rachel. The doctor says youre in agonizing pain, but you wont accept medication. That youre refusing to accept skin grafts. You remember that name you all had for me when I was at Internal Affairs? What was it, Gordon? Harvey ... Say it. Say it! Two Face ... Harvey Two Face. Why should I hide who I am? I know you tried to warn me. Im sorry. Wuertz picked you up. Was he working for them? Do you know who picked up Rachel? Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust. Why would you listen to me now? Im sorry, Harvey. No, no, youre not. Not yet. Hes crazy. Its too much... You should have thought about that before you let the clown out of the box. You want him? I can tell you where hell be this afternoon. Youre not so crazy as you look. I told you Im a man of my word. Wheres the Italian? All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes. I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes. Joker, What do you do with all your money? Im a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite, gunpowder and gasoline! But what ...? And you know the thing that they have in common? Theyre cheap. I want to know how much theyre paying you to say who Batman really is. This is our chance. I want Lau alive. The Joker ... either way. Hey, Jim! Get a load of this. Lets take the next caller. Harvey Dent didnt want to give in to this maniac. Do you think you know better than him? I think that if we could talk to Dent today he may feel differently. And. .. We wish him a speedy recovery. God knows we need him now. You said you were a man of your word. Oh, I am! Im only burning my half. All you care about is money. This town deserves a better class of criminals. and Im gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city. They wont work for a freak. A freak? Why dont we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to your pooches? Hmm? And then well see how loyal a hungry dog really is. Its not about money. Its about sending a message Everything burns.  Who is this?  I had a vision. A world without Batman. The mob ground out a little profit. The police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so ... boring. Ive had a change of heart. I dont want Mr. Reese spoiling everything. But why should I have all the fun? Lets give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isnt dead in I want you to call in every officer. Tell them to head to their nearest hospital. And start evac and search. Call the transport authority, school board, prisons. Get every available bystander to a hospital. The priority is Gotham general. Wheel everyone out of that place now! You, you and you. Come with me. Where are we going, Sir? To get Reese. I need you plugged in checking Gordons men and their families. Looking for ... ? Hospital admissions. Will you be wanting the Batpod, Sir? In the middle of the day, Alfred? Not very subtle. The Lamborghini then? Much more subtle ... Excuse me. Let me through. Excuse me. Sir, could you help, please? Go find a bus for him. Sir, commissioner. Do you really think an ordinary citizen will try to kill this man? See Brian Richards. No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital.  Theyre trying to kill me.  Maybe the Batman can save you. Davis, I got space. Bring him out. Davis! I saw Burns and theres Zachary. Nothing on them. And a patrolman I dont know. So what now ... Where are we going? Send the information to Gordon. Get out of here. Davis! Maam, were going to have to move him now ... Its Berg, isnt it? Yes, Commissioner ... You okay, son? Hi .. You know ... I dont want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey. When you and uh .. Rachel! ... Rachel were being abducted I was sitting in Gordons cage. I didnt rig those charges. Your men, your plan. Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? Im a dog chasing cars. I wouldnt know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just do things. The mob has plans, the cops have plans. Gordons got plans. Theyre schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. Im not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So ... When I say ... Come here. When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal ... You know that Im telling the truth. Im going to need your weapon. What? Why? Because my wife is in the hospital? Yeah. That would be why. Its the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer. You had plans. And look where that got you. The police force are taking every possible precaution urging everyone not to take matters into their own hands. I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. You know ... You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go according to plan. Even if the plan is horrifying. If tomorrow I tell the press that like a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. Because its all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die ... Well then everybody loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order. And everything becomes chaos. Im an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? Its fair. You live ... You die ... Now were talking! Mr. Reese ... Its Mr. Wayne, isnt it? That was a very brave thing you did. Trying to catch the light? You werent protecting the Van? Why? Whos in it? Do you think I should go to the hospital? You dont watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr. Wayne? Southeast ... Thats Gotham general. Did you clear the building? We must know how many were inside! You got patient lists, role calls. Right now, were showing fifty people missing. One bus. All these others buses are heading off to other hospitals. My guess is we missed one. Yeah? Well, whats your guess about where Harvey Dent is? Keep looking. And keep it to yourself. Now if anybody asks, we got him out. Get the mayors office on the line. Were going to need the national guard. Fifty people are missing, including GCNs own Michael Engel. Im now being told that were cutting to a video GCN has just received. Im Michael Engel for Gotham Tonight. What does it take to make you people want to join in? You failed to kill the lawyer. Ive got to get you off the bench and into the game. Come night fall this city is mine. And anyone left here plays by my rules. Mr. Fox, security is showing a breakin at the RND department. If you dont want to be in the game. Get out now. But the bridge and tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise. HA HA! HA HA! Sweet Jesus! Shouldnt you be out there? Doing something? It is my day off. I got to take a leak. Keep an eye out for me. Now what? You need someone to shake it for you? Hello Dent? Jesus ... I thought you was dead. Half. Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz? Must have been Maronis men. Shut up! Are you telling me that youre going to protect the other traitor in Gordons unit? I dont know! He never told me. Listen, Dent. I swear to God I didnt know what they were going to do with you. Thats funny. Because I dont know whats going to happen to you either. Beautiful, isnt it? Beautiful, unethical, dangerous. Youve turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone. And a highfrequency generator receiver. You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong. Ive got to find this man, Lucius. At what cost? The database is nullkey encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person. This is too much power for one person. Thats why I gave it to you. Only you can use it. Spying on 30 million people isnt part of my job description. This is an audio signal. It feeds off within range of any phone the city you can triangulate its position. Ill help you this one time. But consider this my resignation. As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises, I wont be. When you finish, type in your name. My office is looking over every inch of the tunnels and bridges, but with the Jokers threat there are limited options. And land routes east? Backed up for hours. Well just release the ferries. With thirty thousand ready to board. Plus I want to use the ferries so I can get some of those prisoners off the island. The men you and Dent put away? Those arent people Im worried about. You should be. Whatever the Jokers planning its a good bet that Harveys prisoners might be involved. I want to get them out of here. So where is Harvey? We havent found him. Jesus ... How long can you keep this quiet? Dont stop for lights, cops, nothing! Going to join your wife? You love her? Yes You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die? Look take it up with the Joker. He killed your woman. He made you ... like this. The Jokers just a mad dog. I want whoever let him off the leash. I took care of Wuertz. Who is your other man inside Gordons unit? Who picked up Rachel? It must have been someone she trusted. Look, if I tell you youll let me go? Cant hurt your chances. It was Ramirez. But you said ... I said it couldnt hurt your chances. Youre a lucky man. But hes not. Who? Your driver. Hey, man! We should be on that boat! You want to ride a bus with them? Be my guest. Sir, theyve stopped their engines. Right. Get on the radio. Tell them well come back and pick them up once we dump the scum bags. Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in. What the heck was that? Liberty, come in please. This is Spirit. We have the same problem. We lost both engines. Fox. Theres something going on on the ferries. Get down to the engine room now Captain, we got a hundreds barrels down there rigged to blow. And this.  Oh my God!  Looks like some kind of detonator. Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb? Tonight you are all going to be part of a social experiment. For the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate, I am ready right now to blow you all sky high. Liberty, come in. Over. Its dead. Anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die. Im zeroing in. Each of you has a remote to blow off the other boat. The voice is on the ferry. But its not the source. West!  Gordon.  I have the Jokers location. Prewitt Building. Put some along the building offices. At midnight I blow you all up. If however one of you presses the button, Ill let that boat live. So whose it going to be? Harvey Dents mostwanted scum bag collection? Or the sweet and innocent civilians? You choose. Oh! And you might want to decide quickly because... the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble. Stay back! Well who are you to decide? We ought to talk this over at least. We dont have to die. Those men had their chance. We are not going to talk about this. Why arent we talking about it? Theyre talking over the same exact thing on the other boat. Lets put it to a vote. Hello? Barbara. Its Anna Ramirez. Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away. But the units outside? Those cops cant be trusted. Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible. Ill call them off for ten minutes. And youll have to move fast. Where am I supposed to take them? Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out. Okay. Did she believe you? Thats because she trusts you. Just like Rachel did. I didnt know ... Didnt know what they were going to do? Youre the second cop to say that to me. What exactly did you think they were going to do? They got me early on. My mothers hospital bills ... Dont! Im sorry ... You live to fight another day, office. We found the missing hospital bus. And we have a hostage situation. Its a shooting gallery. Why would he choose a spot with such good windows? We have clear shots on five clowns. The snipers take them out, smash the windows, A team repels in, a team moves in by the stairwells. Two, three casualties max. Lets do it. Its not that simple. With the Joker it never is. Whats simple is that every second we dont take in those people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up That wont happen. Then hell blow both of them up! We dont have time for paper. I want everybody to put their votes on this piece of paper. If anyones got a pen pass it along. We need to get the votes in quickly. I need five minutes alone. No! Theres no time! We have clear shots! Dent is in there with them. We have to save Dent. I have to save Dent! Two minutes. Then we rush. Fox, I need picture.  Hello? Jim, were in trouble! Okay. We got POV on alpha. Unveiling beta. It looks like clowns and hostages on 2 floors. A SWAT team on stairwell. Another SWAT team on the roof. Barbara, calm down! He has the kids! Hello Jim. Harvey, wheres my family? Where my family died. Blue Team, acquire the target. Fox, the SWATs targeting the wrong people! The clowns are the hostages! Red Team go! Dont move. Take the shot! Those SWATs are coming in hard. Clown, put down your gun! Doctors get down, clear the line of fire! Freeze! You see those bad guys on the floor above? Theyre waiting for help with the SWAT team coming up the elevator. The tally is 140 against, So go ahead, do it! Were still here. That means, they havent killed us either. Trouble on the floor above. Freeze! Or we will shot! We got him, hes out of the game. Step away from the edge! Dont move! Ah, you made it! Im so thrilled. Wheres the detonator?  Go get him! You dont want to die, but you dont know how to take a life. Give it to me. That man will kill you and take it anyway. Noone wants to get their hands dirty. Fine, Ill do it. Those men on that boat. They made their choices. They chose to murder and steal. It doesnt make any sense for us to have to die too. Oh the old familiar places! Hostages are safe. Give it to me. You can tell I took it by force. Give it to me and Ill do what you should have did 10 minutes ago. We really should stop this fighting. Otherwise, well miss the fireworks!  There wont be any fireworks.  And herewego! What were you trying to prove? That deep down, everyones as ugly as you are? Youre alone! You cant rely on anyone these days, you got to do everything yourself, dont we? Thats okay. I came prepared. Its a funny world that we live in speaking of which, you know how I got these scars? No, but I know how you got these! Ugh, you. You just couldnt let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. Youtruly areincorruptible, arent you, huh? You wont kill me out of some misplaced sense of selfrighteousness. And I wont kill you because youre just too much fun! I think you and I are destined to do this forever. Youll be in a padded cell forever. Maybe we could share one! You know, theyll be doubling up the rate this citys inhabitants are losing their minds. This city just showed you that its full of people ready to believe in good. Until their spirit breaks completely! Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent and all the heroic things hes done. You didnt think Id risk losing the battle for Gothams soul in a fist fight with you? No. You need an ace in the hole. Mines Harvey. What did you do? I took Gothams White Knight and I brought him down to our level. It wasnt hard. You see, madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push! This is where they brought her, Gordon after your men handed her over. This is where she died. I know, I was here, trying to save her. But you didnt!  I couldnt!  Yes, you could have. If you had listened to me if you stood up against corruption instead of doing your deal with the devil! I was trying to fight the mob! You wouldnt dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I lost. Have you ever had to talk to the person you love most To tell them its going to be alright, when you know that its not? Well, youre about to know what it feels like, Gordon. Then you can look me in the eye and tell me youre sorry.  Youre not going to hurt my family.  No, just the person you love most. So, is it your wife? Put the gun down Dent! Harvey, put down the gun. Please. Please Harvey. Please. Goddamn it, will you stop pointing the gun at my family?! We have a winner.  No, Jim, stop him!  Harvey! Harvey Im sorry! For everything! Please, dont hurt my son. You brought your cops?! All they know is this is a situation. They dont know who or what, theyre just creating a perimeter. You think I want to escape from this?! There is no escape from this! You dont want to hurt the boy, Harvey. Its not about what I want! Its about whats fair! You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time! But you were wrong. The world is cruel. And the only morality in a cruel world is chance unbiased, unprejudiced, fair. His sons got the same chance she had What happened to Rachel wasnt chance. We decided to act. We three. Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?! It wasnt. The Joker chose me! Because you were the best of us. He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you could fall. And he was right. Youre the one pointing the gun, Harvey. So point it at the people responsible. Fair enough. You first. My turn. Harvey, youre right. Rachels death was my fault. Tell your boy its going to be alright, Gordon. Lielike I lied. Its going to be alright, son. Daddy! Dad, is he okay? Thank you You dont have to thank me. Yes I do. The Joker won. Harveys prosecution, everything he fought for, undone. Every chance we had at fixing our city dies with Harveys reputation. We bet it all on him. The Joker took the best of us and tore it down. People will lose hope. They wont. They must never know what he did. Five dead, two of them cops. You cant sweep that up. But the Joker cannot win. Gotham needs its true hero.  No.  You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things because Im not a hero, unlike Dent. I killed those people. Thats what I can be. No, No! You cant, youre not! Im whatever Gotham needs me to be. Call it in. A hero. Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight... shining.  Theyll hunt you.  Youll hunt me. Youll condemn me set the dogs on me. Because thats what needs to happen. Because sometimes the truth isnt good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. Batman! Batman! Why is he running, Dad? Because we have to chase him. Okay, were going in! Go, go! Move! He didnt do anything wrong. Because hes the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not a hero hes a silent guardian, a watchful protector a Dark Knight. cy  Black. All important movies start with a black screen. And music. Edgy, scary music that would make a parent or studio executive nervous. And logos. Really long and dramatic logos. Warner Bros. Why not Warner Brothers? I dont know. DC. The house that Batman built. Yeah, what, Superman? Come at me, bro. Im your Kryptonite. Hmm. Not sure what RatPac does, but that logo is macho. I dig it. Okay. Get yourself ready for some reading. If you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself and make a change. Hooo. No. I said that. Batman is very wise. I also have huge pecs and a ninepack. Yeah, Ive got an extra ab. Now, lets start the movie. Gotham Tower, this is McGuffin Airlines, Flight 1138. We are transporting 11 million sticks of dynamite, 17,000 pounds of C4, about 150 cute little classic bombtype bombs, and two best friends! And request permission to fly over the most crimeridden city in the world. Over. Im just looking at all the guys faces here in the control tower.  Im good.  Sounds good to me.  Do it!  Yeah, as long as theyre best friends.  Thumbs up!  Yep, I think were cool with that. Gentlemen, seal breach in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! What was that?  One of us should check it out.  Okay. Scissors, paper, rock.  Paper.  Scissors. Ha! You always do paper. Im a loser at home and a loser at work. Holy cow! Captain Dale, is everything okay? I am afraid Captain Dale had to bail. Im your new copilot. And I always come to work with a smile!  You should be terrified.  Why? Because I will be taking over the city. Mmm...  What?  Batman will stop you. He always stops you. No, he doesnt. What about that time with the two boats? This is better than the two boats.  Mmm...  Well, tonight is gonna be different! Tonight is my greatest plan yet. And trust me, Batmans never gonna see it coming. Like that time with the parade and the Prince music? Hey, quiet!  Good night, Steve.  Take it easy, Jeff. Man, I really like that guy. I sure hope nothing bad happens to him. Nothing bad ever happens to me What the... Your city is under attack by Gothams greatest criminal minds. Including The Riddler. Scarecrow. Pizza delivery.  Bane.  Hello. TwoFace! We need that door open, baby! Catwoman. Meow, meow. Youre in! Meow, meow. Im jumping out of the way! And lets not forget, Clayface. Poison Ivy.  Freeze!  No! You freeze! Mr. Freeze! Penguin, Crazy Quilt, Eraser. PolkaDot Man, Mime, Tarantula. King Tut, Orca, Killer Moth, March Harriet, Zodiac Master, Gentleman Ghost. Clock King, Calendar Man, KiteMan, Catman, ZebraMan, and the Condiment King. Okay, are you making some of those up? Nope, theyre all real. Probably worth a Google.  Hey, watch it!  Commissioner Gordon! What is it, OHara? We just got a report! All the Zgrade villains have broken into the energy plant! What are we gonna do, sir? The only thing we ever do. Flip the switch to the BatSignal! Flip! Commissioner, are you there? The BatSignal, shes been egged! Its Egghead, sir. Im well aware of his work. Dear gosh. Youve destroyed the BatSignal. You have thought of everything. Yeah, I know! And when I take over Gotham City... Opening reactor core doors. ...Batman will grovel at the feet of his greatest enemy! Me! The Joker! Joker, do you read me? 104, girl buddy. Were ready for you, sugar plum. Well, then, lets raise the roof! Fire in the hole! OHara, have you tried the BatPhone? Yes, but all Im getting is this hold music. I love it.  I want snipers trained on that building!  You bet!  I want water and air support, yesterday!  Ahoy, sir! And I need SWAT here now! Phone call for Commissioner Gordon. Hello? Batman? Hi, Jimmy! Its the Jokes. Oop! Nobody calls you that. Yes, people do call me that. Okay, listen up. Go, go, go! At this very moment, an unnecessarily complicated bomb is being attached to the inside of the main energy core. If the mayor isnt here in five minutes to negotiate the citys surrender, then I shall destroy Gotham City. I did something! Doctor, that sounds frightening and overly complicated. Talk us through it. Well, I dont wanna scare any small children who may be listening, but its a littleknown fact that Gotham City is built on a bunch of flimsy plates stuck together. Theres literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear. If Jokers bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever. And you wouldnt want that, now would you? Now get me the mayor! Joker out! Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!  Jim, did you find Batman?  No, maam. Then we have no choice. The Joker has the upper hand. We have to surrender Gotham City. Oh, no. Im sorry! Flying the mayor package in right now. SWAT team, get your stun guns ready!  Nonlethal.  Yeah! Lowering mayor package through hole. Madam Mayor! Thanks for dropping by. Ive only got one thing to say to you, Joker. Well, you better make it fast. Do you like to gamble? Oh, I certainly do. Do you ever play roulette? On occasion. Well, let me give you a word of advice. Im all ears. When playing roulette... Yes? ...always bet on black. Batman? What are you doing? Youre completely outnumbered here! Are you nuts? You wanna get nuts? Come on! Lets get nuts! Cause I just wrote a song about how Im gonna kick all your butts! Stop him before he starts singing! Yeah! In the darkest night I make the bad guys fall Theres a million heroes Computer, overcompensate. But Im the best of them all Im on my way, sir.  Who has the coolest gadgets?  Batman!

And I always get away! Not this time. Cause this time I got you. Oh, yeah? Well, theres only one problem. Whos gonna defuse the bomb? Its gotta be one or the other, Batman. Save the city, or catch your greatest enemy. You cant do both. Im sorry, what did you just say? You cant do both, I said. No, I mean the other thing. Save the city, or catch your greatest enemy. You think youre my greatest enemy? Yes! Youre obsessed with me! No, Im not.  Yes, you are.  No, Im not. Yes, you are! Who else drives you to oneup them the way that I do?  Bane.  No, he doesnt!  Superman.  Supermans not a bad guy! Then Id say that I dont currently have a bad guy. I am fighting a few different people. What? I like to fight around. Okay, look, Im fine with you fighting other people if you wanna do that, but what we have is special. So, when people ask you Whos your number one bad guy? you say... Superman. Are you seriously saying that there is nothing, nothing special about our relationship? Whoa. Let me tell you something, Jbird.  Batman doesnt do ships.  What? As in relationships. There is no us. Batman and Joker are not a thing. I dont need you. I dont need anyone. You mean nothing to me. No one does. Hurray! Batman! You did it! Youre welcome.  Thank you, Batman.  Oh, my pleasure. Batman, we love you! Thank you! Im blushing super hard under the mask.  Grazie, Batman!  Prego.  Youre the best, Batman!  Oh, Im humble.  Thanks, Batman!  Im super modest about it. Thank you.  Batman, youre the greatest!  Oh, pray hands, pray hands.  Thanks for saving the city!  Youre welcome. Batman, I love you more than my kids! So do I, guy! Youre our hero, Batman! I love my life. Computer. Go ahead.  Are we near the orphanage?  Yes. Great. Lets turn those frowns upside down. That sounds like the Batmobile. No way! Hey, orphans! Look whos here! Its Batman! Hey, kids. Who wants a shot from the merch gun?  I do, I do, I do!  Great!  Kaboom!  I got a lunchbox!  Kaboom!  I got a sippy cup!  Kaboom!  I got a Batarang! And the rest of you get Bat Bucks. Kaboom! Remember, kids, if you want to be like Batman, take care of your abs. Batman out! Batman! Batman! Batman! Thanks, Batman. Youre my hero! Whoo! What is the password? Iron Man sucks. Thank you. It must be great to be Batman. I can only imagine he is going home right now to party the night away, surrounded by scores of friends and lady tennis players. Hey, Computer. Im home. Welcome home, sir. Initializing Batcave operating system. Hey, Puter. Whats up, Batman? Put this bomb in the museum. Certainly, sir.  Thank you.  No worries. Anything exciting happen when I was gone? You have four pieces of mail. Great, whatd I get? You have this weeks Pennysaver, two bills, and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond. It expires in two weeks. But Ive heard that some stores will honor them past the expiry date. Copy that. Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor, grouting tiles in the second bathroom of the fifth master bedroom. Do you want me to tell Alfred youre home? No, thats cool, Computer. Thanks for the update. I should probably have some dinner. Alfred left your lobster thermidor in the fridge. Oh, thats my favorite. I cant wait. Oh, not 20 minutes. Stupid. Oh, wait. There, which one is, uh... Okay. You complete me. Shut up. You had me at hello. Love it! Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. I, uh... I saved the city again today. I wish you could have seen me. I think you would have been really proud. There you are! Oh! Alfred! I am so sorry. I have incredible reflexes. No, its all my fault, sir. I should have known better than to sneak up on you like that. Sorry, I was just lost in thought, and as you know, when Im in there, Im in deep. Were you looking at the old family pictures again? At the what? The old family... Oh, yes! I see what you mean. Look at that! The old gang. Yeah. No, I wasnt. I see. Sir, if you dont mind my saying, Im a little concerned. Ive seen you go through similar phases in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005 and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989 and that weird one in 1966. Do you want to talk about how youre feeling right now? I dont talk about feelings, Alfred. I dont have any, Ive never seen one. Im a nightstalking, crimefighting vigilante, and a heavy metal rapping machine. I dont feel anything emotionally, except for rage. 247, 365, at a million percent. And if you think that theres something behind that, then youre crazy. Good night, Alfred. Sir, its morning. Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally. Yeah. I love it. You cant spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night. Yes, I can, cause Im Batman. But dont you think its time you finally faced your greatest fear?  Snakes?  No.  Clowns?  No. Snake clowns? Bruce, listen. Your greatest fear is being a part of a family again. Nope. Now its snake clowns, because you put that idea in my head.  Sir?  Time for pushups! One, two... Were going to 1,000. Im afraid thats not possible, sir. It is possible. Im already at 20. Youre scheduled to go to Jim Gordons retirement party. What? No. I dont wanna do that.  Youre going to have a great time!  No, no, no. You might meet some new people! No, no, no! You could even make some new friends. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! And before you go, we can do your favorite thing. Tuxedo dressup party. Sir, arent you forgetting something?  Nope.  Your cowl. My what, now? Your armored face disguise? Fine.  Happy now?  Indubitably. Good. Must be nice to be happy. Tonight, on Metropolis in Focus, we have our favorite star, Superman! What up, Gotham! Superman, tell me. How do you feel about your recent banishment of Zod to the Phantom Zone? Yeah, look, Pippa, its... Its complicated. Okay? Zod and I, weve had some pretty epic battles over the years. I dont believe I would be Superman without fighting Zod. See? Superman gets it. Why cant Batman? Check it out, guys. I built a CD rack. Tada! And how am I supposed to get Batmans respect when Im working with these human farts? Booboo, look at me. Youre too good for Batman. He needs to open his eyes and see what it feels like when youre not around. Okay? Yeah, Pippa. I couldnt put Zod in a regular prison, right? Hes Zod. Come on! No, he needed to go someplace where he could never harm Metropolis ever again. The Phantom Zone. Ah, yes, the notorious space jail that houses the greatest supervillains of all time. Theyve got, like, the sickest baddies up there. They got, like, this guy.  And her.  Ill get you, my pretty!  To say nothing about him.  Wingardium Leviosa! And these guys. Exterminate! Im starting to get an idea, monkey face. Bruce, over here! Okay, shutterbugs. Look alive, here we go. Im gonna give you three poses. You ready? Kissy face. Oops, I did it again. And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do? Im out of here, guys. Thank you.  Congresswoman.  Mr. Wayne, good to see you.  Senator, looking great.  Bruce. Im starting with the man in the mirror Bruce, any advice for the new commissioner? Long as he knows how to push the button for the BatSignal, hell be fine. Bruce, I dont know how you did it. You cant prove it, you didnt do it. Mr. Wayne, so great to see you! Come and join us! Mr. Prime Minister. Did you have some work done? No way! Bruce Wayne! Hes the greatest orphan of all time. Shamon, Shamon  Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador.  Mr. Wayne!  You want a picture?  That would be swell! Here we go. Party face! Boom. Keep it. Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Wayne. Call me Bruce, champ. Im just so jazzed to meet you, sir. Im sorry, did you say jazzed? Yes! My names Richard Grayson, but all the kids at the orphanage call me Dick.  Well, children can be cruel.  Yeah.  Great to see you, Bruce.  Nice to see you, sir.  So, I had a question for you, sir.  Okay, hit me with it. Do you have any advice on how to get adopted?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph?  Sure. Um, all right, for example, is teeth whitener a good idea?  Yes. There you go, pal.  Thanks!  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Looking good, Bruce.  Thank you so much. How about eyeliner or a foreign language?  Try both.  Bueno. Look, its the new commissioner!  Where? Oh, shes with the mayor!  Okay. Lets see. Here she is, everyone!  Oh, my darling!  Hi, Dad. Mr. Wayne? Should I get experimental surgery to make my eyes larger and more vulnerablelooking? Uh, do that. Uh, Mr. Wayne? Are you currently in the market to adopt a child?  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow. Are you looking for more of a base model orphan  or one that has more upgraded features?  Yep. Like cooking or driftwood art?  Gymnastic abilities?  Yep. Yep. Closeup street magic la David Blaine?  All of it sounds great.  Really? Because all of it sounds like me. Mr. Wayne, do you think youd be interested in adopting me as your future orphan son? Definitely. Oh, this is great! Because all I want is to get adopted, so I can finally stop being alone. Weve gathered here tonight to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon. Goodbye. And we wish him well on his South African jungle safari! Thank you. Now, to introduce you to his exciting new replacement. Everyone, meet your new commissioner! Meet Barbara Gordon!  The new commissioner of Gotham City!  Whoa! She was top of her class at Harvard for Police. She cleaned up the streets of Gothams nearby sister city Bldhaven using statistics and compassion. And now shes bringing her new ideas and her nunchucks to Gotham City. Congratulations, darling.  Thanks, Dad.  Here she is, everyone! Thank you! Thanks! Hurray! Ms. Gordon, over here!  Big smile!  Wow. Thank you for the oversized key to Arkham Asylum. And, uh, whats this? Thank you for the switch to the BatSignal. Nice. Dad, youve always done a great job protecting Gotham City. Flip! Thats me. Thank you. Along with Batman, of course. Whoo! Lets hear it for Batman! Who I wish was here right now. Oh, Im sure hes listening. Id like to ask all of you a question. Are you fed up with crime?  Uhhuh. Were all tired of crime.  Yeah, were sick of it. Great. Then lets talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime. Ive got a fourpoint pilot program that Id love to share with you. I wanna hear all four points.  Its called...  I am ready. It takes a village... Best opening to a title ever. Not a Batman.  Waiter.  Sir?  Can I?  Of course.  Thank you.  My pleasure. Thanks so much.  What?  Look. Batmans been on the job for a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long time. He has aged phenomenally. However, despite all the great work Batman has done for us, Gotham City is still the most crimeridden city in the world.  Shes got a great point.  Interesting. Historically speaking, that is accurate.  He hasnt captured Riddler.  You know, shes right. He hasnt captured Bane.  Huh!  Or Catwoman. Or TwoFace, or any of Gothams other villains! Hes not good at his job. Including the Joker! Shes making a lot of sense. Excuse me. Im so sorry. Excuse me. We love you, Barbara!  Yes.  Hi. Bruce Wayne. Billionaire, bon vivant, gallivanter, playboy, Gothams most eligible bachelor, like, 90 years in a row.  Thats me right there.  I know who you are, Mr. Wayne. You bet you do. Quick quest, what is your problem with Batman, and also, what the heck, dude? Im glad you asked, Mr. Wayne. Im not a Batman hater. But we dont need an unsupervised adult man karatechopping poor people in a Halloween costume. We need to take whats good about Batman... ...and marry it to actual laws and proper ethics and accountability. I hate everything you just said. Because my dream is for the police force to team up with Batman. Waiter. Wouldnt that be better? And I know that, together, the worlds greatest detective... ...and Gothams finest could clean up these crimeridden streets. Forever. Everybody, get down! Grand entrance! Everyone! Make your way to the exits immediately! Run! Team Bane, block the exits. Going somewhere? Clayface, Freeze, bring me the new Commissioner Gordon.  Were on it.  Cool. And, Harley, you know what to do. I sure do. Its time for Operation Take Out the Laundry. Butler One, this is Bat One. Do you copy?  Go ahead, Bat One.  I need my armored face disguise, now! Only if you say the magic word.  Now!  No.  Youre fired.  No. Sir, well talk about this back at the Batcave.  Hey, Puter.  Yes? Initialize masterbuild music. Right away. Collateral damage assessment suggests the Scuttler, sir. Good plan. Madam Mayor, stay close to me. Head for the south exit. Now, maam. Go! Go! Go! Honey, let Batman take care of it. Dad, I got this. Scuttler online. Chief OHara, were coming in hot! Im almost there. Chief, get the mayor to safety. Computer, Ive got the Joker in my sights. Team, I got the Joker in my sights. Joker! Joker. Uh, excuse me? I was about to... Push the BatSignal? Good call. I like your instincts. Ive got a surprise for you guys. And its gonna make you smile. Uhoh! His smile is our grimace. Everybody, get down.  I...  Joker, no! ...surrender. What? Uh, what did you just say? I said, I surrender. Joker, what are you doing? Im sorry, my Batears must be malfunctioning because it sounds... I surrender! Okay, you know what? Cool it. Youre a criminal. You run, and I catch you. Not anymore, Batman. You were right. There is no us. So, theres no point in me trying to fight you anymore. Therefore, I will be surrendering myself to our strongwilled and forwardthinking new commissioner. Blink, blink, blink. Blinkety blink, blink, blink! Thats really suspicious. Yeah, it is. What are you up to, Joker? I just wanna go to Arkham and pay for all of my crimes. Blink, blink, blink. Blinkety blink, blink, blink! Are you actually saying blink? No! Blink, blink, blink. Joker! Thats enough. Okay, Babs. I got this. Not so fast, Batman. You cant fight me anymore. Im off the market. What are you talking about? Im off the menu. You wont get to fight any of this anymore. Man, am I sorry I asked. Anyway, have fun in jail and... Batman, what are you doing? Punching Bane. That was unnecessary. Oh, no, you cant fight Bane anymore either. Really? Yeah. Or Riddler. Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King. Why not? Because were all surrendering. Right, guys? We are? Yes! Riddle me this. What just happened? Its the end of crime! All right!  That was amazing!  Over here, over here!  You did it!  Yeah, of course I did. Im... Sorry, not you. Were talking to Commissioner Gordon.  Well, it was a team effort.  I got this, Babs. Commissioner, how do you feel? Amazing! This is a great first day. Okay.  Question for Batman.  Shoot. What are you gonna do with the rest of your life? What do you mean, the rest of my life? We dont need a vigilante crime fighter now that theres no more crime. Uh, yes, you do. You can spend some quality time with your family. My... Okay, Batman. Well take it from here. All right, listen up. All of you have the right to remain silent. Lets roll out! Toodleoo, Batman!  Bye, Batman.  Au revoir, Batman. Bye, Batman. Bye, Batman! Today is a victory for the citizens of Gotham City! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! No more crime! Is everything okay, sir? Youve barely touched your lobster thermidor. I dont have time to eat lobster thermidor right now! Warrior two. Pigeon pose. Tree pose. Tree pose. Hey, Batman! Barbara! What are you doing? Nothing. I have a very full life. No, I mean, what are you doing here? Surveillance. On the Joker. Batman, we both know the Jokers up to something. Well, then we cant just let him run around loose in a prison. Hes not loose. He has to go someplace outside the law.  Outside the law?  Yeah. Somewhere like, uh... Hi, there. Im here from Phantoms Own Laundry. Here to take that bad stuff off your hands. Wait, thats it! The Phantom Zone. The Phantom Zone? No way! That is super illegal and way outside our jurisdiction. So, why dont you and I work together inside the law, to figure out what hes up to? Batman works alone. Thats my motto. Copyright Batman. Batman, there are no more vigilantes allowed in Gotham City. Okay. Totally got it. Then I have to go into doublesecret super vigilante mode. You said that out loud. I know that she said I said that out loud, but theres no way I did. She has no idea whats going on in my supermind. Supermind? Smoke bomb! Computer, how do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone? Quickest route, no freeways. Puter, do you hear me? Hello, Master Bruce. Alfred, theres something wrong with the Batcomputer. Watch this. Puter. Nothing. Puter. Do you see what Im saying? Theres nothing wrong with it, sir. I have just taken away your computer privileges. The parental lock? You cant do that. Oh, I can. Ive been reading Setting Limits for Your OutofControl Child. You know what? Doesnt matter, cause I have a doublesecret super password that unlocks the parental lock. You mean, Alfred da Buttler, with two Ts? Sir, its time for you to stop this unhealthy behavior. No, its not. You need to take responsibility for your life. Not right now, I dont. And it starts by raising your son. Im sorry. I literally have no idea what youre talking about. The young orphan you adopted at the gala. Remember? Wow! Stairs. Whee! Hes been living here for the past week. Hello, table! Boom! And I must say, Ive grown rather fond of the young lad. Hello, secret camera. You should get to know him. We are family  You and he have a lot in common.  En garde. Hello, family photos. He lost his parents at a very young age. Ive always wanted one of those. Doesnt he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine? Alfred, youve been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay.  Its Pinot grigio, sir.  Whatever it is. Listen, you dont have a family. Youre satisfied serving me. So what do you know about having a surrogate son? Now, Im gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage. Got it? As you wish, sir. Whoopsadaisy. Wait, what are you doing? Dusting. You cant let him into the Batcave! Im not. Im letting him into your life via the Batcave. What? Its the Batcave! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Batman! Whoa! Youre darn right, Whoa. Wait, does Batman live in Bruce Waynes basement? No. Bruce Wayne lives in Batmans attic.  We can have sleepovers every night!  No, we cant.  Wow! Look, its the BatSub!  Wait, dont touch that! Over there, its the BatSpace shuttle. Please, keep your hands off that.  Look, its the BatZeppelin!  Dont touch that either!  Its the BatTrain!  No!  Its the BatKayak.  No!  Its the BatDune buggy.  No! Its the Bat shark repellent? Uh, actually, you can touch that. Its completely useless. Whoa! Thanks, Batman! Please, stand over there. And dont touch, look at, or do anything for the remaining moments you have in my presence. Okay, cool.  Computer.  Go ahead. How do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone? Joker can only be put in the Phantom Zone using the Phantom Zone Projector. Current location, Supermans Fortress of Solitude inside the Atomic Cauldron. However, only a person that isnt shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll can enter the cauldron. Ugh, Im way too buff. You also have beautiful abs, sir. Thats my cross to bear. Additionally, once inside the cauldron, multiple Kryptonian defense systems engage, including the Acid Moat, Ring of Napalm, and the Jaws of Death. Chance of total mission failure is 110. Those are not great odds. Wait a minute.  Hey, kid.  Yes, sir?  Youre super nimble, right?  I sure am!  And small?  Very.  And quiet?  When I desire to be. And 110 expendable? I dont know what that means, but okay. Great. Follow me. We are gonna steal the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.  Steal?  Yeah. We have to right a wrong. And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong, you have to do a wrongright. Gandhi said that. Are we sure Gandhi said that?  Im paraphrasing.  Cool! Preparing Fortress of Solitude infiltration gear. Wow! Look at all these! Do I get a costume for the mission, too? I got a feeling that youll just look like a kid on Halloween. Dont you think? Dont touch that. Whoohoo!  El Mariachi.  I like that one!  That one is culturally insensitive.  Night Terror.  That one!  No way.  This one?  Death Merchant.  No.  Im okay.  This one.  Fire Starter.  This one.  Clawed Reigns.  ExcaliBat.  This one?  Silent but Deadly.  Nope. Batryshnikov. How do we feel about this one? Dressup parties are for grownups only. Wait. Whats that one there? That one was for the assignment called The Jamaican Caper. The locals called me Reggae Man. I love it! Ah! Feels like I was poured into this. My only trouble is, these pants are just a little tight. I dont know if I could throw a kick or jump in them. I got an idea. Rip! Thats better! Now Im free, now Im moving. Come on, Batman. Lets get grooving! I can only look you in the eyes right now.  Sir, what are you doing?  What do you mean? Why is Master Dick dressed like that? How dare you tell me how to parent my kid I just met? To the Batmobile! Hotdiggitydog! Vehicle rotisserie engaged. Retrieving the Speedwagon. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Hey, kid. Lets go.  Oh, shoot!  What? I probably shouldnt leave until I get the thumbs up from my new old man, Bruce Wayne. Uh, yeah. Heres the thing. Bruno and I decided to share custody of you. So I get a say and youre mission approved. No way! Is this really happening? Yeah. Whoohoo! A month ago, I had no dads. Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!  And one of them is Batman!  Yeah. Its raining dads! So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way? I sure am, Dad Two! But first, wheres the seatbelt? The first lesson is, life doesnt give you seatbelts!  Lets go!  Whoohoo! Yes! Faster, Dad! Faster!  Whoo!  Yeah!  Whoo!  Yeah! Yes, yes, yes! Oh! Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry. Get back up in that seat. There you go. Hey, listen. As soon as I get back to the Batcave, Ill make sure that Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay? But for the time being, Im just gonna put my arm right here. And were just gonna gently ease out of here. And here we go. Okay. Like all superheroes, Superman has zero friends, and he spends most of his time basking in sweet, sweet isolation, here at his alone palace. So, Ill keep him busy while you sneak into that vent and get the Projector. Got it? Copy that! Oh, heres an idea. I could also... Whoa, whoa. Dont even finish that thought. See this counter? These are all the good ideas Batman has. And no one else has ever had any good ideas. So dont even try. Your super power... ...is excellent listening and execution of my ideas.  Lets try it out.  Cool! Drop to the ground. Do a backflip. Do a front flip. Triple Axel. Pli. Relev. Jet. Pythagorean theorem. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Physicalize it! A squared plus B squared equals C squared.  Howd I do, Dad?  Mediocre. Yes! And dont call me Dad. Now, begin mission. Yes, Papa. Papa falls into the Dad category. Sup, Supes? Wow. Its Batman.

I can see the target. But theres some kind of laser energy thing that I cant get through. Okay. Ill see if I can shut it off. But Im gonna have to make up an excuse to leave this party without anyone noticing. Bye. Kid, tell me when its off, all right?  Now?  No.  Now?  No.  Now?  Not quite.  Now?  No.  My son...  No. These irreplaceable crystals contain all my knowledge, which I now pass on to... Darn it. Its gotta be one of these. Is this the one? O.M. gosh! You did it, Padre! Its off! Okay.

Thats excellent listening. Shimmy. Strafeleft. Straferight. Avoid. Hey, I was thinking. If Im gonna be a superhero, and go on awesome superhero missions like this one, can we use code names? Mine can be Robin.  Im sorry, say that again?  Robin! As in the small, Midwestern frail bird? Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase. Tweet, tweet, on the street.  Hard pass.  And a song. Fly, Robin, fly Harder pass. Now slide! Okay, kid. Im gonna teach you how to masterbuild your way inside that thing. Yay! Grab those 2x6s, pull out the axle studs, disconnect the 6x10 plates.

Its like looking in a Batmirror. Okay. Leap.  Ive got the Projector, Dad.  Booyah! Now do everything we just did backwards. Oh. Oh! Here you go, Dad. We did it! Yeah! Mission accomplished. That was fun! You okay, Batman? You seem the opposite of stern. Yeah, Im fine. Its just watching you out there, it was like the world wasnt all darkness anymore. For a brief moment I could have sworn I felt something. That feeling is pride, sir. Youre right. I am super proud. Of myself. For being such a good teacher, obviously. Yeah, youre a great teacher. I am? Yeah! I wanna be just like you when I grow up, Padre! Wait, what did you call me? I called you Padre. Its Spanish for Dad. Sorry. Well, isnt it also a cool Spanish way to say buddy? Yeah, I couldve been saying it that way. Then Ill allow it. Oh, youre such a great padre! What are you doing? Im trying to give you a big old hug. Thought you were attacking me. Hey, you up for another top secret superhero mission to defeat the Joker? Oh, I am down to stop that clown. But I dont wanna make my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry. Do you think well be done before my bedtime? Bedtime? Batmans life lesson number two. Vigilantes dont have bedtimes. Yes! So, whats the vigilante policy on cookies? Unlimited! All right, kid. We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon. So, lesson number three. When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally.  Got it?  Yeah! Already failed. Now, what I need you to do is use the naturally dark areas of your costume, and integrate into the dark parts of this environment. Okay.  Can you see me?  Yes.  How about now?  Yes.  What about now? Now?  Yes. Yes. Youre a goner, kid.  Batman?  Barbara! Batman? Batman! Hey, there. Look at you.  Whos this?  Hi, police lady.  Is that your son?  Yes, I am. Is that my son... No, thats just weird. Its weirder if its not your son. Right. No, I dont... Im not in a relationship or anything. I could have a kid. I mean, if I met the right lady, and if she was just standing right in front of me, and we looked at each other and thought, Hey, lets do this. Lets be together.  Batman?  Yes? I hope youre back because youve decided to work together on the Joker case. Uh... Yeah. Absolutely! Great. Ooh. Arkham Asylum.  So, before we question the Joker...  Uhhuh. ...Im gonna need you to hand over all your weapons. I mean, I dont know if I have anything... Oh! I just got a couple here. There.  Is that it?  Yeah. Oh. Of course. What about the utility belt? Anything in your cape? Under your cowl? And your shoes. There we go. Uh... This is really uncomfortable. Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants. Oops.  Batman?  Yes? Why is your not son trying to smuggle the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham? What? Hey, kid. What is this? Batman, give me the Phantom Zone Projector.  No.  Batman! Give me the Phantom Zone Projector! Give it to me! No, no, no! Whoa! Nice. I studied Brazilian jiujitsu at Harvard for Police. Oh, yeah? Well, guess who got a PhD in smoke bombs! Dr. Batman. Guards!

Kid, guard the door, will ya? On it! Take that, Alan! Huh. Looks like youre going to a lot of trouble for little old me. I must be your greatest enemy after all. Right, Batman?  I see what youre trying to do.  And what is that? Youre trying to entrap me into a relationship.  Really?  Yeah, and its not gonna work. Oh, yes, it is. Because Im inside your head.  No, youre not!  No, youre not! I knew youd say that.  No, you didnt!  No, you didnt! And I knew youd say that! See? We arent so different, I and you.  Its, you and I!  Its, you and I!  Argh!  Admit it. Im your greatest enemy. Youre not my greatest enemy, Joker. Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone. Fine, I will. And prove Im your greatest enemy. Batman, dont do this. As long as youre in the Phantom Zone, Ill be saving Gotham City, and thats all that matters to me. Goodbye, Joker. Oh, Batman, thank you! Yes! Thats what I call saving the city again! Batman, what are you doing? Im Batmaning. Im Batman, Im awesome I got a ninepack Stop it! Batman, I cant believe you did this. Hi, police lady. And even worse, youve made this kid into an accessory to your crime. Sorry, kid. Thats okay, maam. As long as Im doing a dime in the big house with my old man, everythings gonna be Aokay. Officers, take this Projector to the evidence room.  You got it.  And get this man some pants. Im good the way I am. B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet? You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman. I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman. But youre not who I thought you were. Uh... What do you mean? You cant be a hero if you only care about yourself. Barbara, I... I think youre underestimating the importance of the Joker being in the Phantom Zone. Really, its kind of a stroke of genius. All the... Hey, where are you going? I just put Joker in the one place he cant do anyone any harm. Yeah. But what if you just gave Joker exactly what he wanted? Oh! Whoa! Look at this place! Am I being too loud?  Hi!  Oh, my gosh! Sorry. I always do that. How about a warning next time? Youre so right, and I am so wrong. Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy. Yeah, bad guy.  My name is Phyllis.  Oh, that was my grandmas name. Now hold still while I scan you. Scanning for badness. Trying to assess whether you are bad. Ugh! Your whole thing screams bad guy. Oh, yeah.

To recruit the universes greatest...  Well do it!  Im sorry? You were going to say something about recruiting the universes greatest villains to conquer a superhero.  Am I right?  Uh, yeah.  Well, were in!  Yay! Really? Because I brought a PowerPoint... Still boring! Yeah. Just get on with it. You want us to humiliate him? I certainly do. Yes. You want us to make him grovel at your feet?

How do you feel about lava? Yes! Lava.  Done.  Yay!  I cant wait to crush buildings.  Excuse me. Hello? Over here. I dont want to be a downer, but how exactly are we going to get outta this place? Oh, leave that to me. Dont wanna jinx us, but Ill be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight. Going up, maam? No. Youre going down! Look out! Smash! I guess youre right. I am going up. Ding! Here comes the... Phantom Zone! Huh? Im gonna go start looting. Hello, Gotham City! The Clown Prince of Crime is back! Commissioner Gordon, you gotta take a look at this. Whats that? A monkey and dog are friends. Not that. That! And Ive come to finally take over the city. But in order to do that, I need to break my friends out of a giant, scary prison.  Hey, guys, he means us!  Yay! And I aint talking about those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!  Oh!  Meouch. Im talking about my new peeps! And theyre just like me. The greatest villains youll ever see. You wanna meet them?  No.  Too bad. Hes evil, hes magic, and its about to get tragic. Its Voldemort. Magic! You are a fish. You are a frog. You are a fish frog. Hes a 9,000yearold incarnation of evil, with an eye forjewelry. Give it up for Sauron! Good afternoon, Gotham City. He likes long, violent walks on historic buildings. Its King Kong! Come at me, Gotham! Commissioner Gordon, these monsters, theyre too powerful. Can you contain them to downtown? Thats gonna be impossible. Half the police force are fish! Sergeant Jackson!

Whos the greatest villain of them all now, Batman? Still not you. Actually, this does look pretty terrifying, BatDad. Whee! Nice destruction all around. Watch your step! Good work, guys! Now, all thats left for me is to rub it in Batmans bat face. Hey, Sauron, doesnt your flaming eye have a unique ability to peer through time and space?  Uhhuh.  Well, I need to find Batman. Wheres homeboys man cave? Hmm. Give me a second. Scary noise. Its beneath Wayne Manor! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a sec. Are you trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is Batman... ...s roommate? Uh... Yeah. Evil army, this way to the Batcave! Good grief! Hey, Batman! Jokers home. Im rubbing my butt all over your stuff. Were going to have to rename this the Buttmobile. Hey, evil army. I need Batman brought here. Now go get him! Joker out! Uh... Padre? Yeah? Do you ever get scared? No. Yeah, thats what I figured, cause youre Batman. Hey, kid. You know who does get scared? Who? Bruce Wayne.  Really?  Yeah. Bruno told me once that sometimes the only way to get out of a down moment is to start boxing. And by boxing, he meant beatboxing. Oh! Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na... Feel it, uhhuh Dick Grayson on the mic, go Oh. Um... Oh, my gosh. This does make me feel better. Okay. Shh. Batman solo. Bat, bat, bat, can I get a bat? Can I get a bat? Bat... The BatFax! Ha! The city needs me. Bang, bang, bang! Excuse me. Can you get the commissioner and show her this?  Batman.  Would you stop doing that? I sent the BatFax. I hate to say this, but youre right. The city needs you. Yes! Let me out. Im only going to let you out on one condition.  Name it.  You cant do it by yourself. Fine. Who am I working with? SEAL Team Six? Fox Force Five? Suicide Squad? No. Me. Oh, I wanna help, too!  And I shall join as well.  Whoa! Alfred Pennyworth at your service, maam.  How did you...  Alfred, you gotta let me out of here. Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything weve ever seen. Speak for yourself. You dont know everything Ive seen. I havent told you everything. And youll never be able to defeat them alone. And itll be more fun if we all do it together! Whats the worst thing that could happen? What are you so afraid of? The thing Im most afraid of? I gotta be honest with you. Its snake clowns. Yeah, thats not a thing. Well then, nothing.  Im not afraid of anything.  Okay. Prove it.  Oh, I will.  Good. Do you know what the BA in Batman stands for?  Not really.  Best At Teamwork. Best At Teamwork Man is my full name. Yay! Were going on a family trip. This is not a family trip. I can wear my costume, too. Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the...  Rip!  Oh! Nope. Under your clothes. Thats perfect.  Rip!  Alfred, what are you doing? I miss the 60s. Hey, can Scarecrow help?  Yeah!  Hes destroying our city, too! Permit us to lend you assistance. Yeah. Why dont we use these guys? What am I gonna do? Get a bunch of criminals together to fight the criminals? Thats a stupid idea. Okay, guys. Game plan. Jokers taken the Projector  to Wayne Manor.  Wayne Manor. Right. Thanks, Batman.  We need that Projector.  Projector. Or theres no way  to blast these monsters...  Monsters.  ...back to the Phantom Zone.  Phantom Zone? Yep. Batman, I really dont need you to finish my...  Sand castles.  No.  Sisters homework.  No.  Succulent something.  No. Um... Everybody? Batman is in Arkham Asylum. Get him! Okay, everyone, grab on to me. Whoa! Weve gotta take cover! Whoa!  Joker has eyes on us.  Where? No! I mean, he literally has a giant eye on us. I think that thing can see our every move! ShakalakaIako. Weve got to destroy it, or well never make it to Wayne Manor. Uh... BatDad? I really think you should see this. Building survey! This buildings not up to code! Gotcha. Is that real lava? Im okay. All right, yeah. Its 100 lava.  Everyone, start throwing me bricks.  Right away, sir.  I need a 4x6. Come on, quick.  Here you go.  I need an elbow.  Elbow. Ow! Whoo! Yes! I did it. Pretty cool, huh?  Batman?  Yeah? Why did you build this thing with only one seat? Cause last I checked, I only had one butt. What the... What have you done to Wayne Manor? Hey, Batman, guess what! I found out one of your secrets.  Uhoh.  What do we have here, Batman? It looks like a bunch of relationship comedies.  Whats that one?  Must Love Dogs. Must love crying.  Marley  Me.  I love the ending. Oh! Serendipity? We have Serendipity? I love that movie! For a loner, Batman, you sure like movies about relationships! Oh! And look what else I found! All your wonderful toys. Accio lightning storm! Uh... Everyone, hold on. Gremlins, dismantle that plane now! Ugly monsters on our three.  Uh... Padre?  Not now, kid. Kind of got my hands full. Ive got good tone. Firing.  Uh... Batman?  Whats up, buddy?  Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?  Why? Uh... Your number two needs to go number one. I thought I told you to go back at the prison.  I tried, but Bane was in there.  So? He had sort of a get out of this bathroom now vibe. I knew I shouldnt have given you that water. Can you hold it in like a big boy? Engine one down. Not a big deal. Dont worry about it. Its fine.  Engine two down.  It does that sometimes. Weve lost engine three. Oh. Could live without it. Engine four! That I do need to fix. Good news. Our bathroom problem is solved. You three wait here while I go fix the engine. Dont worry, Batman. You fix the Batwing, Ill fly. All good, Babs. Ive got my autopilot on it. Done. Autopilot? Thats just a rope! Exactly. All right, guys. Until I get back, ropes in charge. Thanks, rope. All right, lets see. Yes, the piston brake out here. Jet engine brake in here and... Get out of here. No. Give me... No! Stop it! Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him. Im with you, Grandpa! Get off my Padre! Unhand him, you animatronic fiends. What are you two doing here? I told you to stay in the cockpit. You disobeyed me. Youre on a timeout. Batman, youre on a timeout. What? Alfred, you better untimeout me right now! No. Not until you untimeout Master Dick. Guys, youre all untimeouted! We have incoming!  Sir! Watch out for those...  What are you doing? Okay. Everybody, timeout off. Whoohoo! Ive been parented.  Batman, I can help you.

Move over, rope. Hold on! Gotcha! Barbara, did you see that? Batrope saved Alfred. Sick moves, rope. I never doubted you, bro. Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him. Rope! You lied to me! Wait a minute. You mean, without you, Alfred would have been street meat? Batman, trust us. We can do this.  Yeah. I know Gymkata.  Sorry, whats that? Its a gymnasticsbased martial art. I can punch those 80s monsters off the plane. Uh... Okay. Multiple bogeys on our six. Sir, Ill get them off our back. I was a tail gunner for the Royal Air Force. Locked and loaded, sir! Good. Love that! I got an idea. Were gonna change course. I want you to fly straight into that flaming eyeball.  What?  Barbara, trust me. All right. Lets do this. We got a giant sea monster, 12 oclock! Got it.  Weve got his attention.  Hes tracking us. Ive got you now. Eat dirt! Bobs your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers! Okay, Babs, this is it. Fly us straight into that eye, and wait for my signal. Can it come now? Can we make the signal thing happen? Almost there. Almost there!  Fire!  Almost there! That fires coming in hot! Hot, hot, hot! Now! Barbara, dive bomb! My eye! Sauron! Nothing to see. Whoohoo!  Yes! That was so rad!  We did it, everyone! That was so great! Go team! Come on, lets hear it for us! That was incredible! I felt so jazzed! I say jazzed! I gotta give it to you, Batman. That was awesome.  Ha! And you were awesome.  Thanks.  And you were awesome.  I love compliments! And you were awesome, and I was amazing. Im not trying to make it about myself, obviously. But I just wanna make sure that everyone gets a pat on the back.  Because it feels good.  It does feel good. You had a good idea, you had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and I had a great idea. You know what, I think that collectively, Im gonna add... ...one.  No way!  Yes! Man, that feels good. Best team ever! Lets take a photo! All right, everyone, squeeze together. Hang on a second.  Nice and close!  I gotta get my pump on.  Its worth it.  Okay, everybody in? These abs are no fluke. Everyone say, Bat Family! Bat Family! Ooh, lets take a look! Look at that!  Splendid.  Wow. Didnt it turn out great? Hey, guys! Its my first family photo!  Hey, BatDad.  Oh! Whoa. What are you doing? Im trying to give you a big, old HUG. Okay, just... Batman, are you okay? Yeah, Im fine. We are just one big happy fraternity of people who did an awesome job together. I cant think of any other way to put that.  Cool.  So, guys, listen up! Taking the Projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.  A family battle mission!  Right. Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then well head out.  Right away, sir.  Anything for you, Padre. I think Ill need snowshoes. Yeah, I dont think youll need snowshoes, but could you grab that flashlight?  Batman?  Padre? Sir? What are you doing? Hey, Batman. Please, wait! Puter. Yes, sir? Im locking in some coordinates now. Take the Scuttler to the taco stand on the border of Gotham City and Bldhaven. No! I want you to get these guys a couple of chimichangas  and three Jarritos.  Sir! And then keep them there until this whole attack on Gotham City blows over. Padre, please. Dont do this! Batman, you need us! How many times I gotta tell you? Batman works alone. No, we have to stick together. Please. Now go on, Scuttler. Go!  Go! Just get outta here.  Batman.  Padre!  Get moving! Please! Just go. Batman! Please, wait! Scuttler, move out! Youre doing the wrong thing!  Listen to me! Dont do this!  Sir, please. Sir! No! Scanning for intruders. Scanning for intruders. Scanning for intruders. Hi, Bats. What have you done to my... Bruce Waynes house? Youd better hope hes a cool guy and doesnt go crazy. What happened to all your friends? I dont need friends. I dont need anyone to stop you. Are you sure about that? Look in the mirror, Batman. When I saw you working with your friendfamily, I actually thought youd changed. But, no. You pushed them away. Youve run away from every other person in your life. But Im the one youre always chasing. Is this about that stupid greatest enemy thing? No, its not. Not anymore.  You tell him, Joker!  Its time for a fresh start. Hes not worth it. I think after 78 years, I deserve respect! That is right. Respect! Do you realize that you have never once said the words, I hate you, Joker? Not once. Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now. Thats for darn sure. Annoyed is not the same thing! Listen, Batman. I... hate you.  Aww!  Thats nice. Now you say it. Me, too. You wont. You wont change. Cause you cant. You wont, and you cant. Batman will never change. You know what, booboo? Just shut it down. These diseased lunatics are right. Yes, we are! I am not gonna be part of a onesided relationship any longer!  Yes!  What are you talking about?  You and I are done!  What is wrong with you? Im moving on! Thats ridiculous. And on my way out, Im gonna blow up Gotham City! No. Youre not serious. Wingardium Leviosa! No! You know what? For once, Batman, youre right. Im not your greatest enemy. Your greatest enemy is you.  Goodbye, Batman.  Wait a minute. Hold on a second. Good for you, booboo!  Yay!  Everybody, get a bomb. Lets go.  Bomb, bomb, bomb. Lets bomb it out.  Yay! Say goodbye, Gotham City!  Whoa.  Hi! Whoa! Oh, I am so sorry. It was all my fault, I keep doing that. Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy. What are you talking about? Im not a bad guy. But youre all in black. You have a cape. And you wear a big, scary mask. Well, Im not. And you kicked me in the face. Listen, Im Batman. Oof! You even sound like a bad guy. I swear, I am a good guy. Okay, Mr. Batman. Hold still while I scan you. Scanning for badness. Yes, sir?  Youre super nimble, right?  I sure am! And 110 expendable? I dont know what that means, but okay.  Howd I do, Dad?  Mediocre.  Yes!  And dont call me Dad. Sorry. Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage. But doesnt he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine? Listen, you dont have a family. So what do you know about having a surrogate son? Batman! We have to stick together. Please. Joker, you mean nothing to me. No one does. Huh. Youre not a traditional bad guy. But youre not exactly a good guy, either.  Batman?  Padre? You even abandoned your friends. What? Go on, Scuttler. Go.  Batman, no. No!  Dont do this! Abandoned? No. No, I was trying to protect them. By pushing them away? Well, yeah. Are they really the ones youre protecting? Computer, Batmans in danger. Please, Computer, take us back! Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm? Batman programmed me to obey him. But he didnt say to not not rescue him. What are they doing? Come on, guys. Lets hustle. Gotham Citys not gonna blow itself up. Well, hello! Puter, go to supersecret stealth mode.  Hold on!  No! Evil buddies, those are my last three painful reminders of Batman. Run! Come on, Alfred. This way. Wait, wheres Dick? The little guy? Hes over there. Initializing Batcave operating system. Whats he doing? Ive gotta save my family! Just think.  What would Batman do?  What? I know. Not listen to anyone else. Be mean to people. Destroy as much property as possible. Talk in a really low, gravelly voice. And go it alone. Kid, dont do that. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Dont do what I would do! I never even taught you how to drive! Hold on a second, Brick Lady. Im so sorry. I need to get down there and stop this. I cant let you go. My boss will be really mad at me. Yeah. But I bet your boss would be happy if you were able to get all those bad guys back in here. Hmm. She sure would. Then let me try. Let me get down there and help them. But havent you tried that before? This way, Alfred. You do the same thing over and over. Whats gonna change? No! I know what I need to do. Just give me 24 hours, and Ill come back. Whoa! Youve gotta let me go down there and save them. Ill do whatever you want.  Please.  Exterminate! Please. Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here. I promise. And I mean all of them. One of these buttons has to save my friends. Selfdestruct mode activated. Self what?  Master Dick!  No! Dick! Look whos bat! What? Everyone okay? Dick, Alfred, Barbara.  Are you guys...  Were fine, Batman. Listen, I just wanted to say that Im really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really... sss... Soooo... Sorry? Yeah. Whoo! I did it! I dont even know why you bothered coming back. I was afraid. What? The reason I came back was the same reason I left you. I was afraid of feeling the pain you feel when you lose someone close to you. Gotham needs us. So I came back to do this. Flip. Flip? What is that? I dont... You gotta turn around. I call it the BabsSignal. And Im flipping the switch for you. Because saving this city is too big a job for one person. Flip, flip. So, what do you say, Commish? Will you work with me? I need your help. I thought youd never ask. Im very, very proud of you, sir. But theres still only four of us against Jokers entire army. Thats why I called in some backup. Flip! Flip! Flip! Flip!  Whoa!  We saw your signal, and we came to help. Joker may be done with us, but were not done with him. We will be the Jokers reckoning. Joker said mean stuff to us. You were right, Barbara. It takes a village. Not a Batman. Okay. Everybody, listen up. These monsters want to destroy Gotham City. Thats right. We need sick new vehicles. An arsenal of advanced weaponry. Costumes that suit our individual personalities. Rip! And code names to use on our walkietalkies. Call it out! Your name is Lady Bat.  Lady Bat?  Bat Lady.  Veto! Nope. What?  El Batarina. Soccer Mom... Bat? How about a cool costume? Nice! That ones called Batgirl. If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy? And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy, and a kickbutt theme song! Robin? My superhero code name. Oh, yeah. Hit it! Got it! No! Absolutely not. This music is filling me with rage. Lets use it!

Stop moving around, you Muggles. All right, team, lets shut him down. Orca! Youre up, baby! You wanna see a magic trick? Im gonna make you disappear.  Wingardium Levio...  Meyoink!

Yeah! Oh, my gosh. Yes! Here you go, Grandpa. Hey, Batman! Get off my padre! It wasnt useless after all. End this, Batgirl! Adis, shark. Okay, BRB, guys. Im gonna go defuse that... This is the end of Gotham City! As I predicted, were doomed! Were not doomed. I got this. Everyone, grab on to me. Gotcha. Come on, guys. We need to hold this city together. Batrope, no! Everybody, run! No! We have to stick together. Right, Batman? We need to use our heads! Maybe we should build something together.  Heads.  Stick together.  Build something.  Together.  Build.  Together. Together. We should build something together. I got it. Youre right, Babs. We need to stick together. Literally. Robin, quick. Give me a boost. On it, Padre. Were gonna stick together, using our heads, and the most powerful weapon of all. Shredded abs. Lets do this.  Meow, meow.  Yeah, lets do this.  Ready?  Here we go. You got this, Alfred? Yes, sir. Abs of steel. Great! Now you bend, and Ill grab the other side! No!  Batman, whats going on?  Are you okay? Ive got you. Joker! Please, help us! No! Im not gonna help you. At least if this city is destroyed, Ill die knowing Im your greatest enemy! Im gonna have to die to know it. Shut up, Joker! If theres no Gotham, then Ill never get to fight you again. What? Youre the reason why I get up at 400 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick. Youre the reason Ive given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models. And if it wasnt for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people. And you. So if you help me save Gotham, youll help me save us. You just said us. Yeah. Batman and the Joker. What do you say? You had me at shut up. How are your abs, bro? Too much flab, not enough ab. Why? Because I need you to crunch them. Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together. Im just gonna come right out and say it. I hate you, Joker.  I hate you, too.  I hate you more. I hate you the most. I hate you forever. Splendid! We did it, everyone! Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy. Padre, where are you going? I made a promise. I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone. Sorry, kid. Padre, please. Dont call me Padre. Okay. Call me... Dads. My two dads are the same dad. But theyre both leaving. Its gonna be okay, kid. Sometimes, losing people is part of life. But that doesnt mean you stop letting them in. Some very wise people taught me that. My father figure. My platonic coworker buddy, whos a girl, but just a friend. And you. Mi hijo. Its Spanish for son. This is my family, but its your family, too. Do you have a knife? Why? Cause someone needs to cut the tension between the two of us immediately. Okay. I deserved that.  Hi.  Wait a minute. Whats going on? I came back, just like I said I would. You know, Mr. Batman, when youre a talking brick, working at the Phantom Zone, you see a lot of crazy things. But Ive finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself and make a change. Who?  Superman.  What? Im kidding. Its you. Well, I guess Ill be seeing you on the streets, Batman. I guess so. Catch you later, Joker. Lets go, gang. Wait a minute, were not just gonna let these criminals go, right? Ah, come on, Commish. Lets face it. Those guys are no match for the four of us. Well give them a 30minute head start. Besides, you cant fight crime on an empty stomach. Hey, Computer? Were home! What is the password? Iron Man sucks! When Dad and me were fighting, I was giving them my best oneliners. You complete me. Holy family photo, Batman. I love it! White. All important movies end with a white screen. And tying up loose ends. Were coming for you, Gotham City! Like this snake clowns bit.  Snake clowns?  Told you they were real. Did you stick wigs onto snakes?  Maybe.  That is so weird. Can I play that song I wrote for the end credits?  That is a hard pass.  Come on. No! Let the kid play whatever music he wants.  No, no, no!  Please?  No.  Padre? Fine. Puter. Okay, sir. Yay! Now playing Robins happy, poppy music. The kind that makes parents and studio executives happy. Come on, everyone!  Come on, Batman!  No! Wow, that was fun! Really hope nobody was recording that. Let me see. Oh, this thing is on. This thing is recording. I knew Harvey Dent. l was his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. l believed in Harvey Dent. Dr. Pavel, lm CIA. He wasnt alone. Uh, you dont get to bring friends. They are not my friends. Dont worry, no charge for them. And why would l want them? They were trying to grab your prize. They work for the mercenary. The masked man. Bane? Aye. Get them onboard. lll call it in. The flight plan l just filed with the agency... ...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here... ...but only one of you! First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft! Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel? He didnt fly so good! Who wants to try next? Tell me about Bane! Why does he wear the mask? A lot of loyalty for a hired gun! Well, perhaps hes wondering why someone would shoot a man... ...before throwing him out of a plane. At least you can talk. Who are you? lt doesnt matter who we are. What matters is our plan. No one cared who l was till l put on the mask. lf l pull that off, will you die? lt would be extremely painful. Youre a big guy. For you. Was getting caught part of your plan? Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to find out what he told you Nothing. l said nothing. Well, congratulations, you got yourself caught! Sir? Now whats the next step of your master plan? Crashing this plane... ...with no survivors. Mayday, Mayday! Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out! No! No, no, no! No! No! They expect one of us in the wreckage, brother. Have we started the fire? Yes, the fire rises. Calm down, doctor. Now is not the time for fear. That comes later. Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday... ...but were here tonight because its one of the most important. Harvey Dents uncompromising stand against organized crime... ...had made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago. This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime, but this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act... ...gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act... ...and to them l say, Not on my watch. l want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. lm told Mr. Wayne couldnt be here tonight. lm sure hes with us in spirit. And now lm gonna give way to an important voice.... You ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? No one has. Not in years. people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature... ...when he betrayed the trust of this great man... ...and murdered him in cold blood. Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow. Shrimp balls? Thank you. Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. lll let him tell you himself. Commissioner Gordon. The truth? l have... ...written a speech... ...telling the truth about Harvey Dent. Maybe the time isnt right. Maybe right now... ...all you need to know is that there are... ...1 000 inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organizedcrime machine. Maybe, for now, all l should say about the death of Harvey Dent is this lt has not been for nothing. You see the guy who owns the house? No. I heard... ...he never leaves the east wing. l heard he had an accident. Yeah, that hes disfigured. He has to wear a Mr. Till? Why are your people using the main staircase? And wheres Mrs. Bolton? Uh, shes at the bar, sir. Can l help? The east drawing room. Unlock the door, put the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more. lm sorry, Miss Tate. l tried, but he wont see you. And you mustnt take it personally. Everyone knows that Waynes holed up in there with 8inch nails... ...peeing into Mason jars. lts very good of you to let me on the grounds. Why are you wasting your time trying to talk to a man... ...who threw away your investment on some savetheworld vanity project? He cant get your money back. l can. l could try explaining that a savetheworld project, vain or not... ...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett. But you understand only money and the power you think it buys... ...so why waste my time indeed? Second shift reports in? You should spend more time with the mayor. Well, thats your department. Anyone shown him the crime stats? He goes by his gut and it bothers him, no matter what the numbers. Must be popular with his wife. Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland. Hell have plenty of time for visits. The mayors gonna dump him in the spring. Really? Mmhm. But hes a hero. A war hero. This is peacetime. Oh, sorry, sorry. lm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. lt is Mr. Wayne, isnt it? Although you dont have the long nails or, heh, the facial scars, sir. ls that what they say about me? lts just that no one ever sees you. Thats a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother. lt cant be the same one... ...because her pearls are in this safe... ...the manufacturer clearly explained... ...is uncrackable. Oops. Nobody told me it was uncrackable. lm afraid l cant let you take those. Look, you wouldnt beat up a woman any more than l would beat up a cripple. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made. Good night, Mr. Wayne. Can l have a ride? You read my mind. Lets go. Miss Tate was asking to see you again. Shes very persistent. And quite lovely, in case you were wondering. l wasnt. What are you doing? Examining print dust. Weve been robbed. And this is your idea of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it? She took the pearls, tracking device and all. She? One of the maids. Perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house. Perhaps you should start learning to make your own bed. Why were you dusting for prints? l wasnt. She was. Sir. Congressman Gillys wife has been calling in. The congressman never made it home after the Wayne Foundation event. Thats a job for the police? When you and Dent cleaned the streets, you cleaned them good. Pretty soon well be chasing down, uh, overdue library books. And yet here you are, like were still at war. Whats your name, son? Blake, sir. You have something you want to ask me? lts about that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died. The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes down two SWAT teams... ...breaks Dents neck and then just vanishes? lm not hearing a question, son. Dont you want to know who he was? l know exactly who he was. He was the Batman. Lets go see about the congressmans wife. Master Wayne? Master Wayne? You havent been down here in a long time. Trying to find out more about our jewel thief. l ran her prints. Unless shes lost a lot of weight... ...she was wearing someone elses fingerprints. Shes good. She may be, but we have a trace on the necklace. We do. l crossreferenced the address she went back to... ...with police data on highend BandEs, and, um.... Selina Kyle. The databases are full of closecalls, tips from fences. Shes good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet. We should send the police before she fences the pearls. She wont. She likes them too much. And they werent what she was after. What was she after? My fingerprints. lt was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. lt gives a good pull and its untraceable. Fascinating. You two should exchange notes over coffee. Youre trying to set me up with a jewel thief? At this point, ld set you up with a chimpanzee, if it brought you back to the world. Theres nothing out there for me. And thats the problem. You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didnt move on. You never went to find a life. To find someone. Alfred... ...l did find someone. l know, and you lost them. But thats all part of living, sir. But youre not living, youre just waiting, hoping for things to go bad again. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this, before Batman? You were gone seven years. Seven years l waited, hoping that you wouldnt come back. Every year, l took a holiday. l went to Florence. Theres this caf on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening ld sit there and order a Fernet Branca. l had this fantasy... ...that l would look across the tables... ...and ld see you there, with a wife. Maybe a couple of kids. You wouldnt say anything to me, nor me to you. But wed both know that youd made it. That you were happy. l never wanted you to come back to Gotham. l always knew there was nothing here for you, except pain and tragedy. And l wanted something more for you than that. l still do. They wash up here a couple of times a month. More when it gets colder. Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels. We pulled him from the basin, but other than that we didnt touch him. What? Names Jimmy. Hes from St. Swithins. lts the boys home where l coach some ball. Jimmy hadnt been around for months. No? Why? Blake, you know why. He aged out. We dont have the resources to keep boys on after 1 6. l thought the Wayne Foundation gave money for that. Not for the past couple of years. He has a brother here, doesnt he? Mark. lll tell him. ld like to, if thats all right. You know what he was doing in the tunnels? Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out. Say you can live down there. Say theres work down there. Work? What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers? More than you can find up here, l guess. So you know about him? Of course. Do you think hes coming back? l dont know. You brought a date? l like having someone around to open doors for me. Right hand. No partials. Very nice. Mmhm. Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me? Ah, yes. l dont know what youre planning to do with Mr. Waynes prints... ...but lm guessing youll need his thumb. You dont count so good, huh? l count fine. ln fact, lm counting to 1 0 right now. Okay. My friends outside. Just hit send. This place is a little dead. ltll liven up in a minute. Trust me. ls everything okay? Great. Catch you later. Hmm. lt would have been a lot easier... ...to just give me what we agreed. We cant have loose ends. And even in that dress, no ones gonna miss you. No. But my friend over there? Every cop in the citys missing him. Thats cute. But theyre not gonna be looking in a place like this. l dont know. You did just use his cell phone. Go! Go! Police! Get down now! Help me! Help me! Help me, please! Please help me! Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart. Call me? You okay, miss? Hes bleeding. You gotta help him. l got the congressman. Clear! Manhole! Get this up! Get the DWP down here! You three, down with me. You two, you go down, cover the next exit! What, they went down there? Were gonna go down there, right? That was a gas explosion, kid. Wasnt gas. lts a sewer. No one goes in till we know whats there. We know, sir. The police commissioner. Someone get this hothead out of here? And wheres that DWP guy? Why are you here? Answer him. l was asking you. lts the police commissioner. And you brought him down here? We didnt know what to do. You panicked. And your weakness has cost the lives of three others. No, hes alone. Search him. Then l will kill you. Hes dead. So show me his body. The water runs to any one of the outflows. Wed never find him. Follow him! Follow him? You okay? You okay? Hey, hey, you awake? l need to see Bruce Wayne. lm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesnt take unscheduled calls. Even from a police officer. And if l go get a warrant for the investigation of Harvey Dents murder? That still count as unscheduled? What can l do for you, officer? Commissioner Gordons been shot. He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When l pulled him out, he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called Bane. Shouldnt you be telling your superior officers? They asked me if he saw any giant alligators. He needs you. He needs the Batman. lf Commissioner Gordon thinks Oh, he doesnt know or care who you are. But weve met before. lt was a long time ago. l was a kid. Uh, St. Swithins. lt used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. lts an orphanage. My mom died when l was small. lt was a car accident, l dont really remember it. But my dad got shot a couple years later over a gambling debt... ...and l remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like, do they? To be angry... ...in your bones. l mean, they understand. Foster parents. Everybody understands... ...for a while. And then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he cant do. Move on. So after a while, they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boys home. l figured it out too late. You gotta learn to hide the anger. Practice smiling in a mirror. lts like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car. Pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited. Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. l mean, we used to make up stories about you, man. Legends. And, you know, with the other kids, thats all it was, just stories, but.... Right when l saw you, l knew who you really were. ld seen that look on your face before. lts the same one l taught myself. l dont know why you took the fall for Dents murder... ...but lm still a believer in the Batman... ...even if youre not. Why did you say that your boys home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation? Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air. Start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help. You check that name? Bane? Hes a mercenary. No other known names. Him and his men were behind a coup in West Africa... ...that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett. Now Daggetts brought them here. Or so it seems. lll keep digging. Yeah. Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys homes in the city? The foundation is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises. There have to be some. Time to talk to Mr. Fox, l think. lll get him on the phone. No, no, no. Do we still have any cars around the place? Yes. One or two. l need an appointment at the hospital for my leg. Which hospital? Whichever one Jim Gordons in. l have seen worse cartilage in knees. Thats good. No. Thats because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys... ...the residual concussive damage to your brain tissue... ...and the general scarredover quality of your body... ...l cannot recommend that you go heliskiing. Right. We were in this together... ...then you were gone. The Batman wasnt needed anymore. We won. Based on a lie. And now theres evil rising from where we tried to bury it. The Batman has to come back. What if he doesnt exist anymore? He must. You took my goddamn wallet, didnt you? You f You took my wallet! No, l Get out. She took my Ah! Now. Creep! l dont know what hes so upset about. Theres only 60 bucks in here. Probably the watch. Whos that? A stiff can barely climb out of his sports car. No, thats Bruce Wayne! Mr. Wayne, over here! lm not sure if my assistant Right through here. Thank you so much. Bruce Wayne at a charity ball. Miss Tate, isnt it? Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things. The proceeds go to the big fat spread. lts not about charity. lts about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on. Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne. Oh. And the proceeds will go where they should, because l paid for the big fat spread myself. Thats very generous of you. You have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world. Take our cleanenergy project. Sometimes the investment doesnt pay off. lm sorry. You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesnt care about the world doesnt spend half his fortune to save it. And isnt so wounded when it fails... ...that he goes into hiding. Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne. Mind if l cut in? Thank you. You dont seem happy to see me. You were supposed to be a shutin. l felt like some fresh air. Why didnt you call the police? l have a powerful friend who deals with things like this. Thats a brazen costume for a cat burglar. Yeah? Who are you pretending to be? Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Whos your date? His wifes in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they might get stolen. lts pronounced Ibiza. You wouldnt want these folks realizing youre a crook, not a social climber. You think l care what anyone in this room thinks of me? l doubt you care what anyone in any room thinks of you. Dont condescend, Mr. Wayne. You dont know a thing about me. Well, Selina Kyle, l know you came here from your walkup in Old Town. A modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means that either youre saving for retirement... ...or youre in deep with the wrong people. You dont get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor. Actually, l was born in the Regency Room. l started out doing what l had to. Once youve done what you had to, they never let you do what you want to. Start fresh. Ugh. Theres no fresh start in todays world. Any 1 2yearold with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. ls that how you justify stealing? l take what l need from those who have more than enough. l dont stand on the shoulders of people with less. Robin Hood? l think ld do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you. You think maybe youre assuming a little too much? Maybe youre being unrealistic about whats really in your pants other than your wallet. Ouch. You think all this can last? Theres a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits... ...youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large... ...and leave so little for the rest of us. You sound like youre looking forward to it. lm adaptable. Those pearls do look better on you than they did in my safe. But l still cant let you keep them. You You scared her off! Not likely. Must have lost my ticket. Your wife said you were taking a cab home. My wife? Just you, sir? Dont worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back in the swing of things. Bruce Wayne, as l live and breathe. What brings you out of cryosleep, Mr. Wayne? You havent lost your sense of humor. Even if you have lost most of my money. Actually, you did that. lf you funnel your entire R and D budget... ...into a fusion project that you then mothball... ...your company is unlikely to thrive. What are my options? Well, if youre unwilling to turn on the machine.... l cant. l cant, Lucius. Well, then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at bay... ...while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate. She has supported the project all the way. Shes smart. And quite lovely. We all just want whats best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine. lll think it over. Anything else? Nope. Why? These conversations used to end with an unusual request. l retired. Mmhm. Well, let me show you some stuff anyway. Just for old times sake. l figured youd have shut this place down. Oh, it was always shut down, officially. All this new stuff. After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up 14 different defense subsidiaries. For years, lve been shuttering and consolidating... ...all the different prototypes under one roof. My roof. Why? Keep them from falling into the wrong hands. Oh, now youre just showing off. Defense Department projects for tight geometry urban pacification. Rotors are configured to maneuver between buildings without recirculation. Whats it called? Oh, it has a long, uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. l just took to calling it the Bat. And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Works fine, except for the autopilot. Takes a better mind than mine to fix it. Better mind? Well, l was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours. ls it really painful? Youre very welcome to try it, Alfred. Happy watching. Thank you, sir. Not bad. Not bad at all. lf youre seriously considering going back out there... ...you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane. lm all ears. There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes the pit sends something back. Bane. Bane. Born and raised in hell on earth. Born in a prison? No one knows why, or how he escaped. But they do know that once he did... ...he was trained by Ras Al Ghul, your mentor. Bane was a member of the League of Shadows? And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ras Al Ghul is not to be trifled with. l didnt realize l was known for trifling with criminals. That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put your mask back on... ...but that doesnt make you what you were. lf this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me. The city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources. Your knowledge. lt doesnt need your body, or your life. That times past. Youre afraid that if l go back out there, lll fail. No. lm afraid that you want to. You cant short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party. Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad. l vote bad. On what basis? l flipped a coin. lt says rye l said no rye, man. Hey, rookie, lose the helmet. We need faces for camera. Come on. Lets go scalping. Come on. Everybody down, now! This is a stock exchange. Theres no money you can steal. Really? Then why are you people here? Everybody, stay back! Go down to the end of the block! We have an emergency situation! You gotta get in there! This is a hostage situation. No, this is a robbery. They have direct access to the online trading desk. lm not risking my men for your money. We have to ask you to move. We have a situation. lts not our money, its everybodys. Really? Mines in my mattress. You dont put these guys down, that stuffing in your mattress might be worth a whole lot less. Cut the fiber cable and take out that cell tower. Thank you. Thatll slow them down. Move back! All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please! They cut the fiber. Cells working. For now. Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No one gets in or out of any of these streets. Where am l supposed to move it? Back it up. All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay? How much longer does the program need? Eight minutes. Time to go mobile. Everybody, up! You two, move! Thank you. Steady. Steady. lve got something. Hold your fire, theyve got hostages. Hold your fire! Go, go! Please! Just let me go! Hey, please! Hey! Shoot the tires. Theres no shot. Now back off. Back off, theyve got hostages. P.D. are pursuing the four suspects through downtown... ...in response to a hostage situation. Whats going on with the lights? lt cant be. What the hell was that? Oh, boy, you are in for a show tonight, son. Please! Help, help, help! Sorry. Put that thing away before you hurt yourself. Get in! Lets go. You, get in the car. Theyve spotted the Batman. Call everyone in. Every car patrol, beat cop, offduty too. Pull them in now. lm gonna do what Jim Gordon never could. Whats that? lm gonna take down the Batman. are confirming four suspects are carrying two hostages... ...kidnapped from the Gotham Stock Exchange. Reports from the eyewitnesses Scott, dead center of your screen. What do you see? I see Batman. Hard to believe, but the suspects are now being pursued... ...by what appears to be the Batman. Well, what do you know? Sir, what about the armed robbers? Please! Just let me go! Please! One bikes pulled off. No hostage. Should we pursue? Negative. Stay on the Batman. Hes getting away. Who do you wanna catch? Some robber, or the son of a bitch who killed Harvey Dent? the entire upper west hill... ...Central Heights and East Park Side areas. Eight years, and he has to pick tonight. Hes drawing the cops off Bane. Please! Just let me go! Please! We lost him. How could you lose him? Hes got a lot of firepower. What, and you dont? Hes heading back downtown. Then hes as dumb as he dresses. Close it off, gentlemen. Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen. You might have the wrong animal there, sir. You sure it was him? Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished. What about the men they arrested? He said, and l quote, They would die before talking. Where does he find these guys? Open the champagne. And can we get some girls in here? Careful what you wish for. Cat got your tongue? You dumb bitch. Nobody ever accused me of being dumb. Youre dumb for coming here tonight. l want what you owe me. Want doesnt get. Nice outfit. Those heels make it tough to walk? l dont know. Aah! Do they? So where is it? Wheres what? The program. The clean slate. The ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. Hold it right there! Where is it? The clean slate? Where you type in someones name, date of birth... ...in a few minutes theyre gone from every database on earth? Sound a little too good to be true? Youre lying! Rykin Data took it to prototype stage. Thats why l bought them. But they had nothing. lt was a gangland myth. Stay back! lm not bluffing! They know. They just dont care. Youve gotta be kidding me. No guns. No killing. Wheres the fun in that? My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men. This isnt a car. See you around. Youre welcome. l had it under control. Those werent street thugs. They were trained killers. l saved your life. ln return, l need to know what you did with Bruce Waynes fingerprints. Wayne wasnt kidding about a powerful friend. l sold his prints to Daggett... ...for something that doesnt even exist. l doubt many people get the better of you. Hey, when a girls desperate.... Whats he gonna do with them? l dont know... ...but Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market. Miss Kyle? So thats what that feels like. l see from the television coverage that you got your taste for wanton destruction back. l retrieved this. Arent the police supposed to be investigating, then? They dont have the tools to analyze it. They would if you gave them to them. One mans tool is another mans weapon. ln your mind, perhaps. But there arent many things you cant turn into a weapon. Alfred, enough. The police werent getting it done. Perhaps they might have if you hadnt made a sideshow of yourself. You thought l didnt have it in me. You led a bloated police force on a chase... ...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him? What then? lll fight harder. l always have. Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training. l see the power of belief. l see the League of Shadows resurgent. You said he was excommunicated. By Ras Al Ghul. Who leads them now? Ras Al Ghul was the League of Shadows and l beat him. Bane is a mercenary. We need to find out what hes up to. Trades of some kind. Coded. And my fingerprint, courtesy of Selina Kyle. Get this to Fox. He can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing. lll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more. lve sewn you up, lve set your bones, but l wont bury you. lve buried enough members of the Wayne family. Youll leave me? You see only one end to your journey. Leaving is all l have to make you understand. Youre not Batman anymore. You have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing, about a life beyond that awful cave. Alfred, Rachel died knowing that we had decided to be together. That was my life beyond the cave. l cant just move on. She She didnt. She couldnt. What if she had? She l cant change that. What if before she died she wrote a letter... ...saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if... ...to spare you pain... ...l burnt that letter? How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me? l am using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe its time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day. lm sorry. Youre sorry? You expect to destroy my world... ...and then think that were gonna shake hands? No, no, no. l know what this means. What does it mean? lt means your hatred. And it also means losing someone that l have cared for... ...since l first heard his cries echo... ...through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. Goodbye, Alfred. Alfred? Answering your own door? Yeah. Page three. Seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange... ...verified by thumbprint. Those options expired at midnight last night. Longterm, we may be able to prove fraud. But for now, youre completely broke... ...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett. The weapons. We cant let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences. Applied Sciences is all locked up and off the books. The energy project, however, is a different story. Miranda Tate. Lets convince the board to get behind her. Lets show her the reactor. Were meeting her there in 35 minutes, so you better get dressed. You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox? Bear with me, Miss Tate. Please keep hands and feet inside the car at all times. This is it, isnt it? The reactor is beneath the river... ...so it can be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach. ls Bruce Wayne really that paranoid? lm gonna plead the fifth on that one. l thought you might like to see what your investment built. No fossil fuels. Free clean energy for an entire city. Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper... ...on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later, your reactor started developing problems. l think this machine works. Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great. Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist... ...died in a plane crash six months ago? Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon. l need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises... ...and this reactor. To do what with it? Nothing. Until we can guarantee its safety. And if we cant? Decommission it. Flood it. Destroy the worlds best chance for a sustainable future? lf the worlds not ready, yes. Bruce, if you want to save the world, you have to start trusting it. lm trusting you. Doesnt count. You have no choice. l could have flooded this chamber at any time. lm choosing to trust you. Please. All right, ladies and gentlemen. This meeting will now come to order. ld like to point out that we have a nonboard member here... ...which is highly irregular, even if his family name is above the door. Bruce Waynes family built this company. And he himself has run it. lnto the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree? Check the share price this morning. Crazy gambling on futures has not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat... ...its cost us all a lot of money. And he has to go. lm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne. Now, back to business. Mr. Wayne, over here! Hows it feel to be one of the people? Mr. Wayne, theyre towing your car! l didnt know what to do, they had paperwork. Looks like you need a ride, huh? Wayne, well give you a ride! How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board? She been meeting with him? Sleeping with him? Not that we know of. You dont know much of anything, do you? Wheres Bane? We told him it was urgent. Where is that masked? Speak of the devil... ...and he shall appear. What the hell is going on? The plan is proceeding as expected. Oh, really? Do l look like lm running Wayne Enterprises right now? Your hit on the stock exchange, it didnt work, my friend. And now you have my construction crews going around the city at 24 hours a day. How exactly is that supposed to help my company absorb Waynes? Leave us. No. You stay here. lm in charge. Do you feel in charge? lve paid you a small fortune. And this gives you power over me? What is this? Your money and infrastructure have been important... ...till now. What are you? lm Gothams reckoning. Here to end the borrowed time youve all been living on. Youre pure evil. lm necessary evil. No. No, no, no! When you started, why the mask? To protect the people closest to me. But you were a loner, right? You didnt have any family? There are always people you care about. You just dont realize how much until theyre gone. The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody. That was the point. Well, it was damn good to see him back. Not everybody agrees. Theyll figure that out in the end. You got anything on Banes whereabouts? Yeah. l got 500 pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. l could use some help, actually. You know what? Drop me in Old Town. Hey, hey, hey. l dont think so! Thats the way this works! l dont think so! That is the way Hes not a mark. And he doesnt have a cent to his name, anyway. Yeah, its not much. But its more than youve got right now. Actually, theyre letting me keep the house. The rich dont even go broke the same as the rest of us, huh? My powerful friend might hope to change your mind about leaving. And how would he do that? By giving you what you want. lt doesnt exist. He says it does. He wants to meet tonight. Why? He needs to find Bane. Says youd know how. Tell him lll think about it. Okay. l like your place. Mr. Wayne? lm sorry they took all your money. No, youre not. Can we help you, officer? Uh, yeah. John Daggetts body was just found in a Dumpster about an hour ago. Thought you might want to know. Why? His names all over these permits l just pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham. Thats MTA maintenance, uh, sewer construction, couple of other things. Where did you get to with the tunnel searches? Remind me to tell detail to keep hotheads out. Weve had teams down there. lts a huge network. Well, get more men. Work a grid. l want him found. Yeah, the, uh, masked man. Were on it. Lose the uniform, youre working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here. Sir, that could also be a coincidence. Youre a detective now, son. Youre not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Nobodys answering. No. lm on my own now. Do you have keys? Never needed them. Hope you didnt like me for my money. Suffering builds character. lll take care of your parents legacy, Bruce. Whos this? Wheres Alfred? He left... ...taking everything. Whats that? My powers been shut off. Youre good at that. When l was a child, we had almost nothing. But on the nights when we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed. l assumed your family was wealthy. Not always. Not when l was young. An old mistake. lve made a few myself. More than a few. We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted. Someday, perhaps. Not tonight. Dont be shy. Wayne says you can get me the clean slate. That depends. On what? On what you want it for. l acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands. Still dont trust me, huh? How can we change that? Start by taking me to Bane. You asked. From here, Banes men patrol the tunnels. And theyre not your average brawlers. Neither am l. Hes behind you. Who? Me. What do you think youre? Just a little further. l had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me. You made a serious mistake. Not as serious as yours, l fear. Bane. Lets not stand on ceremony here... ...Mr. Wayne. Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you. Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated, arent we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us. Us? You were excommunicated... ...by a gang of psychopaths. l am the League of Shadows. And lm here to fulfill Ras Al Ghuls destiny. You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. Admirable, but mistaken. Oh, you think darkness is your ally? But you merely adopted the dark. l was born in it. Molded by it. l didnt see the light until l was already a man. By then, it was nothing to me but blinding! The shadows betray you because they belong to me! l will show you where l have made my home... ...whilst preparing to bring justice. Then l will break you. Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it. Ah, yes. l was wondering what would break first. Your spirit... ...or your body. Get me Commissioner Gordon. l got a line on the congressmans kidnapping. Excuse me, miss. Uh, yes? lm gonna need to see your ticket and identification, please. Oh. Do you mind? l showed your picture to the congressman. Guess what. Dont tell me. Still in love? Oh, head over heels. Pressing charges, though. Youve made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle. Girls gotta eat. And you have an appetite. Why would you run? You cant hide with a record like this. Maybe its not you lm running from. Who then? Bane? What do you know about him? That you should be as afraid of him as l am. We can offer you protection. Okay. When l spotted you, l was looking for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne. Did they kill him? lm not sure. Why didnt you just... ...kill me? You dont fear death, you welcome it. Your punishment must be more severe. Torture? Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul. Where am l? Home. Where l learned the truth about despair. As will you. There is a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries... ...has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy. So simple. And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater from uncontrollable thirst... ...many have died trying. l learned here there can be no true despair without hope. So as l terrorize Gotham... ...l will feed its people hope to poison their souls. l will let them believe that they can survive... ...so that you can watch them clambering over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you have truly understood the depth of your failure... ...we will fulfill Ras Al Ghuls destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when it is done... ...and Gotham is... ...ashes... ...then you have my permission to die. Youre locking her up in here? The Dent Act allows nonsegregation based on extraordinary need. First time she broke out of womens correctional, she was 1 6. Little closer, baby. Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand? Shes gonna be fine. l still dont see the need of a board meeting for the energy project. Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark was not one of them. How good of you to join us. Chair. President. All l need now is one more ordinary board member. Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate? No. l will volunteer. Where are you taking us? You were right, commissioner. Will you excuse us, please? What happened? Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but he took three into the sewers. No more patrols. No more hide and seek. Get every available cop down there and smoke him out! The mayor wont want panic. So its a training exercise. lm sorry l didnt take you seriously. Not you. Youre telling me the Batmans gone... ...so you chase up the Daggett leads any way you can. Yes, sir. He asks how much you would pay us to let you die. l told him. l told him you have nothing. Do it for the pleasure. They pay me more than that to keep you alive. He will try the climb. Has anyone ever made it? Of course not. He says there is one who did. A child. A child born in this hell. Bane. An old legend. Nothing more. Dont. Whatever it is they want you to see, its happening soon. Fire in the hole! Turn it on. l only need one other board member. There are eight others waiting. l wont do it. All right, stop. Lucius, youll kill this man, and yourself... ...and youll barely slow them down. Go on, then. Do your work. Take them up to the surface. People of their status... ...deserve to experience the next era of western civilization. lve been to half of Daggetts cement plants and locations they poured underground. Anything strange about the pourings? Honestly, commissioner, l dont know anything about civil engineering. But you know about patterns. Keep looking. lts done. This is now a 4megaton nuclear bomb. Pull the core out of the reactor. No, you cannot. This is the only power source capable of sustaining it. lf you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months. Five, by my calculations. And then it will go off! And for the sake of your children, Dr. Pavel... ...indeed l hope it does. Hey. Hey! That was you in front of the stock exchange, wasnt it? When? When? When cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck was shutting them out. Oh, yeah. Youre the cop. Detective now. And, uh, as a detective, were not allowed to believe in coincidence. What were you doing here? What are you working on? Commissioner, its Blake. l got two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me whenev Wait a minute. lm looking at four barrels of polyisobutylene. That looks like motor oil right next to it. Jesus, theyre not making cement. Theyre making explosives. Patch me in to Foley. Foleys overseeing the operation. Theyre heading into a trap! Were seeing thousands of police heading into the sewers. Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands. lts a training exercise, thats all. Now if youll excuse me, lve got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City. Foley. lts a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane has been pouring concrete... ...laced with explosives! Where? Oh, say, can you see By the dawns early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilights.... Theres a ring around the tunnels! Theyll blow it and trap the cops underground! Pull them out. Pull them out now! Through the perilous fight Oer the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rockets red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through Thats a lovely, lovely voice. that our flag was still there Oh, say does that starspangled banner Yet wave Oer the land of the free And the home of the brave Let the games begin. Everybody okay? Lets move! Move, move! Go, go! Gotham... ...take control. Take control of your city. Foley. Jesus, Blake. Every cop in the citys in those tunnels. Not every cop. Sir, are you okay? lm a police officer. l need your car right now. Clear the corners, rookie. Get my coat, son. This.... This is the instrument of your liberation. Satellite shows a radiation spike. Whatever it is, its nuclear. ldentify yourself to the world. Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist. Pavel was confirmed dead. Plane crash on an agency pull out of Uzbekistan, but.... lt looks like its him. And what...? What is this? lts a fully primed neutron bomb... ...with a blast radius of six miles. And who is capable of disarming such a device? Only me. Only you. Thank you, good doctor! Now, this bomb is armed! And this bomb is mobile! And the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. For one of you holds the detonator! Now, we come here not as conquerors... ...but as liberators, to return control of this city to the people. And at the first sign of interference from the outside world... ...or from those people attempting to flee... ...this anonymous Gothamite... ...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close... ...and wait. Tomorrow, you claim what is rightfully yours. Pull back the fighters. Start highlevel reconnaissance flights. Get the president on the line. Tanks and planes cannot stop us from detonating our device. Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication. How many of you are there, son? You dont have enough men to stop 1 2 million people from leaving this island. No. No, we dont. But you do. Now, why the hell would l try to help you keep your hostages? lf one person crosses this bridge... ...Gotham gets blown to hell. The people of our greatest city are resilient. They have proven this before, and they will prove it again. We do not negotiate with terrorists... ...but we do recognize realities. As this situation develops... ...one thing must be understood above all others. People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you. What does that mean? lt means were on our own. l have to get in front of a camera. They will kill you the second you show your face. Bane says hes giving Gotham back to the people. They need to know l could lead. Banes not gonna let that happen. Then hell show his true colors. And youll be dead. Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison... ...where a thousand men have languished... ...under the name of this man Harvey Dent. Who has been held up to you... ...as the shining example of justice! Were just gonna keep moving you till we can get you in front of the camera. You have been supplied with a false idol to stop you... ...tearing down this corrupt city! Yes! Yes! Yes! Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. From the words of Gothams police commissioner... ...James Gordon The Batman didnt murder Harvey Dent. He saved my boy... ...then took the blame for Harveys appalling crimes... ...so that l could, to my shame... ...build a lie around this... ...fallen idol. l praised the madman who tried to murder my own child. Well, l can no longer live with my lie. lt is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth... ...and it is time for me to resign. And do you accept this mans resignation? And do you accept the resignation of all of these liars? Of all the corrupt? Those men locked up for eight years in Blackgate... ...and denied parole under the Dent Act, it was based on a lie. Gotham needed a hero. Well, it needs it now more than ever, but you betrayed everything you stood for. Theres a point far out there when the structures fail you... ...when the rules arent weapons anymore... ...theyre shackles, letting the bad guy get ahead. One day, you may face... ...such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, l hope you have a friend like l did... ...to plunge their hands into the filth, so that you can keep yours clean! Your hands look plenty filthy to me, commissioner. We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations... ...who have kept you down with myths of opportunity. And we give it back to you... ...the people. Gotham is yours! None shall interfere. Do as you please. But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed! Open it! Step forward, those who would serve... ...for an army will be raised. The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests... ...and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure! Courts will be convened. Spoils will be enjoyed. Blood will be shed! The police will survive... ...as they learn to serve true justice. This great city... ...it will endure. Gotham will survive! He says you must first fix your back. How does he know? He was the prison doctor. Hes a morphine addict who incurred the displeasure... ...of powerful people, including your masked friend. How? Many years ago, it was a time of plague. Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane. The doctors fumbling attempts to repair the damage... ...left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds the pain at bay. Bane was the child you spoke of? He was born here? The legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for a local warlord. He fell in love with the warlords daughter. They were married in secret. When the warlord found out... ...the mercenary was condemned to this pit. But then he exiled him instead. The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release. But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom. She took his place in the pit. And she was with child... ...the mercenarys child. lnnocence cannot flower underground. lt has to be stamped out. One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell. But the child had a friend... ...a protector who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption. lt was to be prized. The mother was not so lucky. This is Banes prison now. He wouldnt want this story told. Theres a vertebra protruding from your back. lt has to be put back. Stay like this until you stand. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Did you not think l would return, Bruce? Hmm? l told you l was immortal. l watched l watched you die. Oh, there are many forms of immortality. Once, l had a wife... ...my great love. She was taken from me. You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir. An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty... ...to restore balance to civilization. No. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years... ...with all your strength... ...all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you could achieve was a lie. Now you understand. Gotham is beyond saving. No. And must be allowed to die. No! Yeah, just lift your head. Oh, thats good. No, no! Whats that? This was someones home. And now its everyones home. Theres a storm coming, remember? This is what you wanted. lts for the bus, in case theres a chance to evacuate. Any news? ls the commissioner? The less you know, Father. How are the boys doing? Well, weve had more power on, so theyve got some TV. lts good to see you. Blake, you be careful out there. Theyre hunting down cops like dogs. Why build yourself? lm not meant to die in here. Here, there. Whats the difference? l told you it could not be done. You told me a child did it. But no ordinary child. A child born in hell. Forged from suffering. Hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege. We got boots on the ground, sir. Just waiting on intel. You have ID? Of course not. Well, how can we trust you? We dont have any choice. Commissioner Gordon. Captain Jones, Special Forces. Captain. Glad to have you here. lts our job, sir. Now, uh, how many of you are there? Well, theres dozens. ld rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost 3000. Condition? Getting food and water. Can we break them out? Yes, sir. Take out the mercenaries south of Ackerman Park. Blow the rubble, make a hole big enough for 1 0 at a time. lm in contact with my partner whos down there. Theyre just waiting. Men who havent seen daylight in months? Officers who havent seen daylight in months. What about the bomb? Satellite cant pick up radiation hot spots. They keep it on a truck. lt must have a leadlined roof. They move it constantly. Good. So you know the truck? Well, its one of three. Weve been tracking it. Decoy. You dont really think hes coming back? Doesnt matter what l think. Actually, it does. You should put your faith in something a little more real. The routes dont vary much. Okay. What about the triggerman? No leads. lts a bluff. Bane wouldnt give control of that bomb to someone else. We cant take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device. And meanwhile, Gotham lives under a warlord, like some failed state? Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented. We cant do anything to risk millions of lives. You gonna tell him whats really going on? Captain, the situation is more complicated than you think. Theres someone you need to meet. Came upstairs looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation. What corporation? Wayne Enterprises. You good? Mr. Fox, would you like to brief the captain? Miss Tates fully aware of the situation. And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, l have to take responsibility for it. Why? We built it. You built the bomb? lt was built as a fusion reactor. First of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor. Heres the important part. As the devices fuel cells deteriorate... ...it becomes increasingly unstable... ...to the point of detonation. This bomb is a time bomb. And it will go off in 23 days, regardless of Banes revolution... ...or what we, or the outside world, choose to do. So your plan might not be as practical as you thought. Could you disarm it? l could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it. Lets move from this location and call it in. Right. Lets go. No, no, well take it from here. You stay and look after these folks. Someone sold us out. Go, go, go! lll die before l talk. lm on your schedule, captain. There were people living upstairs. Round them up for judgment... ...and hang them where the world can see. Police have cordoned off the entire Central Heights and East Park Side areas... ...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline Boulevards in an attempt He says the leap to freedom is not about strength. My body makes the jump. Survival is the spirit. The soul. My soul is as ready to escape as my body. Fear is why you fail. No, lm not afraid. lm angry. Bruce. Why do we fall? You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. lt makes you weak. Why? How can you move faster than possible... ...fight longer than possible... ...without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death. l do fear death. l fear dying in here... ...while my city burns. Theres no one there to save it. Then make the climb. How? As the child did... ...without the rope. Then fear will find you again. Ah, supplies for your journey? Oh, thats wonderful. Thats.... What does that mean? Rise. No. No, theres been a mistake! Take me to Bane! l want to see Bane! Order! This is a mistake! Where is Bane? Theres been no mistake, Mr. Stryver. You are Philip Stryver... ...executive vice president of Daggett lndustries... ...who for years has been living off the blood and sweat... ...of people less powerful than him. Call Bane. l am one of you. Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. Now, the choice is yours. Exile or death! Order! Exi Exile. Sold. To the man in the cold sweat. You follow the thick ice. You try to swim, youre dead in minutes. Has anyone made it? Where are they? lts not like we have a lot of time. How long? The bomb goes off tomorrow. We have about 1 8 hours to do something. To do what? To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can start to figure out how to bring it down. Thats it? Foley. Wheres Foley, damn it? You shouldnt be out on the streets. Jim, hes not here. You let your wife come to the door? When the citys under occupation? Wait in the kitchen, honey. What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard? You saw what they did to those Special Forces. Have you forgotten all the years we were out on patrol? When every gangbanger wanted to plant one as soon as our backs were turned? That was different. These guys run the city. The governments done a deal with them. Banes got their balls in a vice. Thats not a deal. You move on Bane, the triggerman is gonna hit the button. You think hes given control of that bomb to one of the people? You think this is part of some revolution? Theres one man with his finger on the button. Thats Bane. Look, weve all got to keep our heads down till they can fix this. lf you still had a family here This only gets fixed from inside... ...the city! Look, Peter. lm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues, but something has to be done. Sorry, Jim. l gotta Keep your head down? What goods that gonna do when that thing blows? You dont know thats gonna happen. l hear youre looking for men, commissioner. How about me instead? Miss Tate, l, uh, cant ask you to do that. Please. You little punk! Whatd you take? Nothing! l didnt take anything! You steal from us, you little bastard? Now, you boys know you cant come into my neighborhood without asking politely. Never steal anything from someone you cant outrun, kid. Youre pretty generous for a thief. l thought they killed you. Not yet. lf youre expecting an apology, l lt wouldnt suit you. l need your help. And why would l help you? For this. Clean slate. Youd trust me with that? After what l did to you? lll admit, l was a little let down. But l still think theres more to you. ln fact, l think that for you... ...this isnt just a tool. lts an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. l cant even get off this island. l can give you a way off... ...once you get me to Lucius Fox. Find out where theyre holding him and take me in. Why do you need Fox? To save the city. Who says it needs saving? Maybe l like it this way. Maybe you do... ...but tomorrow that bombs going off. Got your powerful friend on the case? lm trying... ...but l need Fox. As it approaches... ...flip the switch. The needle hits 200, you give me the signal, lll mark the truck. Okay? Heads up, heads up. l got it. Mercenaries on your 6. Stand still! Keep your hands where we can see them! Commissioner Gordon, you are under arrest. On whose authority? The people of Gotham. No lawyer? No witnesses? What sort of due process is this? Your guilt has been determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. Now, what will it be? Death or exile? Crane, if you think were going out onto that ice willingly... ...you have another thing coming. Death, then. Looks that way. Very well. Death... ...by exile. Bring her to me. Hey, were going now. Blake says theyre ready! Get your gear on! Hey, you hear me? Were going now. Lets do it. Find this one a spot, got a big day tomorrow. We all do. lts not every day you bag Bruce Wayne. Bruce. You okay? Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne. How long until that core ignites? That bomb goes off in 12 hours. Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor. Can you get Miranda out of here? Not tonight. lm sorry. Do whats necessary. Tonight l need you. What for? To get me back in the game. Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys to himself. l wont forget about you, Miranda. l know. l like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne. He should be so lucky. Any move l make on Bane or the bomb... ...the triggerman sets it off. Well, they wont use radio or cell. Too much interference. lnfrared doesnt have the range. ltll have to be a microburst. Longwave. Could you block it? Yes. But lll need the EMP cannon guidance mount from the Bat. Remember where you parked? She fly okay? Yeah, even without the autopilot. Thanks. Autopilot? Thats what youre there for. Okay. lts clear. Come on, quick. One at a time. Wait, wait! Ross! Ross? Lock it up. No, keep down. Get down! Who are you? Light it up. Dad, check it out. Honey, come take a look. lmpossible. Keep her close. Hell come for her. Wheres Miranda Tate? Bane took her. Hes holed up at city hall, surrounded by his army. This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get it onto it before sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts. When what starts? War. You missed a spot. lf youre working alone, wear a mask. lm not afraid to be seen standing up to them. The mask is not for you. lts to protect the people you care about. Count to five, then throw. No offense, but you got something bigger in that belt? What now? Allout assault on Bane. But you need to get people across the bridge. Why? ln case we fail. Lead an exodus. Save as many lives as you can. You dont need me here? Youve given me an army. Now go. Hey, thanks. Dont thank me yet. Well, l might not get a chance later. You shouldnt have.

Goodbye. l climbed out of the pit. l found my father... ...and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance. But by that time... ...the prisoners and doctor had done their work to my friend. My protector. The League took us in. Trained us. But my father could not accept Bane. He saw only a monster. His very existence was a reminder of the hell hed left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. l could not forgive my father. Until you murdered him. He was trying to kill millions of innocent people. lnnocent is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. l honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience. You see... ...its the slow knife... ...the knife that takes its time. The knife... ...that waits years without forgetting... ...then slips quietly between the bones. Thats the knife... ...that cuts deepest. Please. Maybe your knife... ...was too slow. The truck is under attack. Gordon. You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter. Hes bought Gotham 1 1 minutes. Come on! This way! Stay there! What are you doing?

Software patch. Six months ago. Check the ID on the patch. Bruce Wayne. Any news on the missing item? Not yet. They better leave no stone unturned. We cant leave a string of pearls on the manifest as lost. Hey! ...a dark and stormy Halloween. Good evening and welcome to GC1 News live at 800. Our top story tonight, justreleased polls have incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. and 28yearold grassroots challenger Bella Rel in a dead heat. Things certainly got hot last night in their final debate before next Tuesdays election. Now, my young opponent here wants to gut the Gotham Renewal Program, established by the great Thomas Wayne. Cutting funds from vital projects like our sea wall and the safety net for those who need it. The Renewal Program is broken. This citys been renewing for 20 years. Look where its gotten us. Crime has skyrocketed. Murder and drug use are at historic highs. Now wait... Now hang on. We have a masked vigilante running the street. Under my administration, the Gotham PD has dealt major blows to organized crime and drug trafficking. The Salvatore Maroni case was the biggest drug bust in city history. But drops and other drugs are still rampant. Its gotten worse. Im not saying there isnt work to do. But listen... I have a beautiful wife and young son, okay? And I will not rest... Hey. Yeah, Im watching it now. Why is she still tied? But I thought we were getting a bump in the new Post poll. Okay, you know what? I cant watch this anymore. Just call me in the morning, okay? ...who still believes in everything this city can do. We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell, not a cheerleader. And someone who will tell the people the truth. Thursday, October 31st. The city streets are crowded for the holiday. Even with the rain. Hidden in the chaos is the element, waiting to strike like snakes. But Im there too. Watching. Two years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal. I must choose my targets carefully.  Come on! Give me the money.  Okay.  Lets go! Lets go!  All right, all right! Its a big city. I cant be everywhere. But they dont know where I am. Look at this guy, man. Boom! Whoohoohoo! So good, man. Thats what Im talking about! Yo, lets see your hits. Thats you. We have a signal now. For when Im needed. But when that light hits the sky, its not just a call. Its a warning. To them. Fear... is a tool. Are you out of your mind? Watch where youre goin, drophead! They think Im hiding in the shadows. Come on! But I am the shadows.  Come on, come on.  Whoo!  Hey, go on, man! Go!  Get him!  Come on, man!  What are you doin? Help! Somebody help me! Help, help! Where you goin, huh? Come on. Come on, man. Break it. You cant move, huh? Now knock his ass out. Showtime. Showtime, man. Come on, man. Come on. Do it, man. You see this guy? The hell are you supposed to be? Im vengeance. Holy shit. Its him. Hey, man. No, no, no! Please dont hurt me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Police action. Hes with me, Officer. Are you kidding me, sir? Youre gonna let him in here? Martinez, let him through. Goddamn freak. What do we know? Detective? Sorry, Lieutenant. We got blunt force trauma. Lacerations on the head. He got hit a lot of times. And hard. All this blood is from his head? No. Excuse me. Most of its from his hand. Thumb was severed. Killer may have taken it as a trophy. He was alive when it was cut off. Ecchymosis... around the wound. Security detail downstairs said the family was out trickortreatin. The mayor was up here alone. Killer may have come through the skylight. You said there was a card. Yeah. From your secret friend. Whoo? Havent a clue? Lets play a game, just me and you. What does a liar do when hes dead? Theres a cipher too. Any of this mean anything to you? Whats going on here? I asked him to come, Pete. This is a crime scene. Its Mitchell, for chrissakes! I got the press downstairs. You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim, cause we got history. But this is way over the line. Wait.  Hes involved in this?  No, hes not involved. How do you know? Hes a goddamn vigilante! He could be a suspect! What are you doin to me? We used to be partners. Im just trying to find the connection, Pete. He lies still. Excuse me? The riddle. What does a liar do when hes dead? He lies still. Oh, Jesus. This must be your favorite night of the year, huh, pal? Happy fuckin Halloween. Excuse me, Commissioner. Theyre ready for your statement. I want him outta here. Now! Come on. Yeah. The kid found him. Was there anyone else in the house when you arrived? We really gotta go, man. Tonight, a son lost a father. A wife lost a husband. And I lost a friend. Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city, and I will not rest until his killer is found. This was a truly senseless crime, and we are actively pursuing every investigative lead we have in order to identify the perpetrator and hunt him down. Ive spoken to the governor... I wish I could say Im making a difference, but I dont know. Murder, robberies, assault. Two years later, theyre all up. And now this. The citys eating itself. Maybe its beyond saving. But I have to try. Push myself. These nights all roll together in a rush behind the mask. Sometimes in the morning, I have to force myself to remember everything that happened. Unbelievable breaking news this hour, everyone. Again, fourterm incumbent Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. was found murdered last night inside his home in the exclusive Crest Hill district. Exact details of the crime still have not been released, but a citywide manhunt is already underway as police and FBI search for the brazen killer. And this certainly is not the first time Gotham has been rocked by the murder of a political figure. In fact, in an eerie coincidence, it was 20 years ago this week that celebrated billionaire philanthropist Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha were slain during Waynes own mayoral campaign. It was a shocking crime that remains unsolved to this day. Don Mitchell, Jr.s political career was especially notable for his tough war on drugs when he and city police launched a major sting operation, resulting in the arrest of notorious mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni with what, to this day, remains the biggest drug bust in GCPD history. I assume you heard about this. Yeah. Oh, I see. All this blood is from his head? Dear God. Theres a cipher too. Any of this mean anything to you? The killer left this for the Batman? I asked him to come, Pete. Apparently. Youre becoming quite a celebrity. Why is he writing to you? Its Mitchell, for chrissakes! I dont know yet. I got the press downstairs. Have a shower. Our accounting friends at Wayne Enterprises are coming for breakfast. Here? Why? Because I couldnt get you to go there. I havent got time for this. Its getting serious, Bruce. If this continues, it wont be long before youve nothing left. I dont care about that. Any of that. You dont care about your familys legacy? What Im doing is my familys legacy. If I cant change things here, if I cant have an effect, then I dont care what happens to me. Thats what Im afraid of. Alfred, stop. Youre not my father. Im well aware. We really gotta go, man. Some fresh berries there. What are you doing? Just reminiscing about my days in the Circus. This is actually quite elusive. Whered you get those Os? He lies still is only a partial key. It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T. So, Im looking for any double symbols to start, trying letters, see where it leads. Thats interesting. Mr. Pennyworth? Yes, Dory? The accountants are here. See them in, please, Dory. What if its not a partial key? What do you mean? What if this is the whole key? Ignore the symbols we dont have letters for. Use only the letters from He lies still and leave the rest... Blank. Yeah, I understand. But that would leave most of the cipher unsolved. I dont see how thats gonna... Oh. Damn. Yeah, hes got a car. Guess its good to be the mayor. Where to even start? You sure this isnt a leap? Drive could mean anything. You dont trust me? You mean like you trust me? Its been two years now, and I dont even know who you are, man. There. What are we looking for? A USB port. USB? What? Thumb drive. Jesus. Its encrypted. Try this. Oh, this guys hilarious. Oh, well, well, well. So much for family values. Who is she? No idea. But thats the Penguin, Carmine Falcones right hand. I know who he is. What was that? Shit, shit! The drive. It sent out the photos from my account. Gotham Post, Gazette, GC1, all of them. Jesus. Im gonna catch hell for this. Petes gonna bust a gasket. He lies still. About her? Maybe. Thats the Iceberg Lounge. Its under the Shoreline Lofts where Falcone was holed up. Never get in there without a warrant. Yeah. Know who I am? Yeah. I got an idea. I want to see the Penguin. I dont know what youre talking about, pal. Whats the problem? Says he wants to see the Penguin. Penguin? Theres no Penguin here. Thats what I tried to tell him. Get out of here, freak. You hear me? Or that little suits gonna get all full of blood. Mine or yours? Get him! I saw that whole thing. Hes over there! What is your problem? Hey! Put the bat down, or Ill blow your head off! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy, sweetheart. You looking for me? I see you met the twins. Boy, youre everything they say, aint ya? I guess we both are. How you doing? Im Oz. Who is she? I really dont know, chief. I might have been coming out at the same time, but I wasnt rolling with them. Its okay, baby. Mr. Vengeance here, he dont bite. Come on. Thank you, honey. Here you go, champ. I wanna know who she is, and what she has to do with this murder.  Whose murder?  The mayors. Is that the mayor? Oh, shit, it is. Look at that. Dont make me hurt you. You better watch it. You know my reputation? Yeah, I do. Do you? Look... Im just the proprietor, okay? I mean, what people do here aint got nothing to do with me. Tell you one thing. Whoever she is, shes one hot chick. Why dont you ask Mitchells wife? Maybe she knows. What? Too soon? You let me know if theres anything else I can do. Taxi! Taxi! Hey, its me. Baby, whats wrong? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. I cant... On the news? Okay. No. No, stay there. Wait for me, okay? Wait for me, Im on my way home. Listen, baby, were gonna get the hell out of here, okay? I promise. If we have to leave earlier, well leave tonight. Uh... God damn it. ...photos of murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. with a younger mystery woman. In a shocking development, the police believe the photos themselves... Now they urge her to contact the GCPD... Youre pretty good at that. Hey! Give me that. Kosolov, Annika. He hurt her? Thats why you killed him? What? Oh, please. Just give me the goddamn... Listen, honey, you got the wrong idea, okay? I didnt kill anybody. Im here for my friend. Shes trying to get the hell out of here, and this son of a bitch stole her passport. What does she know? Whatever it is, its got her so spooked she wont even tell me. She did seem upset. Back at your place. Lets go talk to her. Anni! Baby! Anni! Anni! Its gonna be cool this evening. Its gonna be down into the 40s. More breaking news this hour as the city is rocked by a second highprofile murder in as many nights. And this time, the killer has come forward to claim credit online... Jesus, what are they gonna do to her? Shes just a kid. Shit, they took my phone. His victim, longtime head of the Gotham City PD, Commissioner Pete Savage, was found dead earlier tonight inside the Police Athletic League facilities in the Tricorner area. The killer posted the following message on social media, and we have to warn you, the video is very disturbing. Hello, people of Gotham. This is the Riddler speaking. On Halloween night, I killed your mayor because he was not who he pretended to be. But I am not done. Here is another... who will soon be losing face. I will kill again, and again, and again, until our day of judgment when the truth about our city will finally... be unmasked. Goodbye! Commissioner Savage served a distinguished 30year career on the GCPD... Holy shit, I seen that guy too. At the club. The Iceberg Lounge? 44 Below. What is that? The club within the club. The real club. Its a mob hangout. Is that where you work? Selina? No, I just work the bar upstairs. But I see em come in. Who? A lot of guys that shouldnt be there, I can tell you that. Your basic upstanding citizen types. Youre gonna help me on this. For your friend. You got a lot of cats. I have a thing about strays. Youre not safe here. I can take care of myself. Two public figures now dead in just the last two nights, and only days before the election. Police and city officials are left searching for a killer and hoping to find him before he kills again. He waited for him at the gym. Pete always liked to work out late at night, when no one else was around. Theres a needle mark on his neck. Injected him with arsenic. Rat poison. Yeah. That seems to be his theme here. Look at this thing. Its a maze. What kind of demented son of a bitch does this to a person? More symbols. Its another cipher. He blasted these out after his message went viral. Bastard murders you and your reputation. That guy pushes drops. On the east end. I dont get it. Why would Pete get involved in something like this? Looks like he got greedy. You kidding me? After everything we did to take down the Maronis? We busted their entire operation, then he caves to some lowlife dealer? Maybe hes not who you thought. You make it sound like he had it coming. He was a cop. Crossed a line. Im mad about you. Want to know my name? Just look inside and see. Follow the maze until you find the rat. Bring him into the light, and youll find where Im at. The hell is that? Bring him into the light? Find the rat? I dont know. Lieutenant. Theyre coming back. We got to get out of here. Come on. Ow! I dont know about these things. I need to see in there, this hunting ground. Hey, why am I starting to feel like a fish on a hook? Im just looking for Annika. Boy, youre a real sweetheart. You really dont care what happens to me in there tonight, do you? Look at me. Looks good. Here. I got you. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hey, where you goin? Hospitality. Thats one of the guys I got into it with the other night. Looks like I broke his nose. Kenzie, William. Hes an offduty cop. Are you sure no one can see these things in my eyes? Dont worry. Im watching you. Dont look away. I need time to make IDs. Great. These guys have a little problem with eye contact, dont they? Feels good, doesnt it? Yeah, baby. Feels real good. Jesus, I hate dropheads. Really? Cause when I first saw you, it looked like you were dealing for Penguin. You dont know what youre talking about. Can we not... Can we not do this right now? Wait. Who was that? Oh, I saw him. Look back. If I look back, its gonna be a whole can of worms. I need to see his face. Jesus. Thats the DA. Gil Colson. And hes coming over. You happy? Talk to him. Hey. How you doing? Hi. Im Gil. Hey, arent you the DA? Yeah. Wow. Ive seen you on TV. Is that right? I havent seen you around here before. Its a hell of a time to be the new girl, cause people are all a little on edge. Oh, honey, I live on the edge. Is that right? I like that. Do you want to come over? Sure.  This is Travis.  Hey. You wanna take a seat over there?  Richie, Glen.  Hey. Thats half the DAs office. You know Carla here, huh? Hi. Thats Cheri. Dont mind her, shes just taking a break. Drowning our sorrows. You want a drop? Uh, no, Im good. But you enjoy. Hope you dont mind. I got a lot on my shoulders with that psycho running around. Hes wasted. No shit. I like this girl. Oh, hey, I like you too! I mean, this Riddler, hes going after the most powerful people in the city. He knows so much. He doesnt know shit, man. What are you talking about? Yeah, he does! What about that rat... Hey, hey, Gil, come on.  Think maybe you had a little too much.  Hey. The rat.  Slow down.  Ask him about the rat. Hey, whats this about a rat? I mean... there was a rat. We had an informant. We had bigtime information on Salvatore Maroni. Thats how we got him out of the drops business. Hes talking about the Maroni case. But if this guy knows, its gonna come out. And when it does, this whole citys gonna come apart. Okay, I dont wanna hear this. This is the kind of pillow talk that got that Russian girl disappeared. What do you know about that? Does anybody want a drink? I want a drink. Keep him talking. Wait, where are you going? She knows Annika. No, stay on the DA. I told you Im looking for my friend.  Wheres Annika?  Out of my face. I dont know you. Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?  What have you heard? Is she okay?  Jesus Christ, keep your voice down. What, you got a death wish? Hey, whats the problem, ladies? Theres no problem. Its just girl talk. Lets keep it festive down here, all right? Sure thing, Oz. Hey. Hey. Been a long time since I seen you down here. How you been? Yeah, Ive been okay. I was just... I was just headed back upstairs. Well... dont be a stranger.  You know Carmine Falcone.  I told you its a mob spot. You didnt tell me you had a relationship with him. I dont have a relationship with him, okay?  Well, thats not what it looked like.  Forget it. Wait, what are you doing?  Listen, I cant do this anymore.  No! No! Taxi! Hey! I lost you in there. Yeah, I gotta go. Oh, you need a ride? Thats me right there. Taxi! Im good. I hope, uh... Ill see you around. Just hold still. What do you know about a confidential informant in the Maroni case? Yeah, sure, there was. Thats the rat were looking for. Somehow Riddler knows who he is. If we find the rat, maybe itll lead us to him. Where are you getting this? I have a source who spoke to the DA tonight. Gils very nervous. I think the killers targeting people close to that case. I worked that case. Riddlers not after you. How do you know? Youre not corrupt. Colsons dirty? Maybe I, uh... I go after him. Lean on him to give up the rat. Its too dangerous. They made a secret deal with this guy. Who knows how many people it touches. Politicians. Police. The courts. It could tear the whole city apart. Jesus, this is a powder keg. And Riddlers the match. You know Carmine Falcone. I told you its a mob spot. You didnt tell me you had a relationship with him. I dont have a relationship... You didnt tell me you had a relationship with him. I dont have a relationship with him. Okay? You know Carmine Falcone. I told you its a mob spot. You didnt tell me you had a relationship with him. I dont have a relationship with him. Okay? Pretty. She a new friend of yours? Im not so sure. Looks like you upset her. Shall I take this as a good sign? What? Your attire. Is Bruce Wayne making an actual appearance? Theres a public memorial for Mayor Mitchell. Serial killers like to follow reactions to their crimes. Riddler might not be able to resist. Oh, that reminds me. Ive taken the liberty of doing a little work on this latest cipher. The one from the rat maze. Im afraid his Spanish is not perfect, but Im fairly certain this translates to, You are El Rata Alada. Rata Alada? Rat with wings? Its slang for pigeon. Does that mean anything to you? Yeah. A stool pigeon. Where are your cufflinks? I couldnt find them. Well, you cant go out like that. Alfred, I dont want your cufflinks. You have to keep up appearances. Youre still a Wayne. And what about you? Are you a Wayne? Your father gave them to me. No more lies! No more lies! Mr. Wayne. All right. All right, youre going straight down there. Is that Bruce Wayne? Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Hold it. You good, fellas? Good. Were good, Mr. Falcone. Sir? Hey! Give us a wide berth here, would you, slick? Hey, watch it, fellas. You got the prince of the city there. Some event, huh? Brought out the one guy in the city more reclusive than me. Thought youd never leave the Shoreline. Arent you afraid someonell take a shot at you? Why? Cause your father aint around? Oz, you know Bruce Wayne? Wow. Is that right? His father saved my life. I got shot in the chest. Right here. I couldnt go to no hospital, so we showed up on his doorstep. Operated right on the dining room table. Kid here, he saw the whole thing, up on the stairs looking down. I remember your face. You dont think that meant something, he did that? It meant he took the Hippocratic oath. Hippocratic oath. Thats good. Excuse me. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming to todays memorial for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. Our program will begin shortly. As a reminder, the family asked that those wishing to honor the mayors memory consider a donation to the cause most dear to his heart... ...the Gotham Renewal Fund, our citys safety net. What goods a safety net doesnt catch anybody? Didnt help my daughter when she needed it, I can tell you that. The guy was just another rich scumsucker. He got what he deserved. Know what I mean? Hey, dont I know you? Bruce Wayne. Why havent you called me back? Im sorry? Im Bella Rel. Im running for mayor. I wouldnt be bothering you here, but your people keep telling me youre unavailable. Will you walk with me? Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne. You know, you really could be doing more for this city. Your family has a history of philanthropy, but as far as I can tell, youre not doing anything. If Im elected, I want to change that. Thank you. My God. Im gonna go pay my respects. Will you wait for me? I want to continue this. Excuse me. Im so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Excuse me, chief. Can I talk to you? Gil Colson is missing. What? He hasnt been heard from since last night. Christ, not again. Hey. Mr. Wayne. You got people looking for him, Jim? Sent a couple guys to his house. Nothing. Whatd his wife say? She hadnt heard from him. Get out of the car! Get out of the car and show your hands! Get out! Get em up! Get out! Show em! Christ, its Colson. Theres a bomb around his neck! Lets clear this place out now! Weve got to get this place cleared out! Hey, guys, guys. Here we go. We dont know if hes in on it. Whats he looking at? Holy shit. Are you kidding me? What the hell is he doing? Gordon! Your guys gonna get himself killed in there. Please.  He made me do it.  Im so sorry. He told me if I didnt do exactly what he said, hed kill me. Im so sorry. Looks like a combination lock. Cant we just cut it off? Not if you want to keep your head. You came. Who are you? Me? Im nobody. Im just an instrument, here to unmask the truth about this cesspool we call a city. Unmask? Yes. Lets do it together, okay? Ive been trying to reach you. Youre part of this too. How am I a part of this? Youll see. Hey, Chief. You better take a look at this. Say hello to my followers. Were live. Theyre here to watch our little trial. At the moment, the man across from you, Mr. Colson, is dead. Jesus, can we get somebody out here? This psychos gonna kill me! But wait a minute... Shut up! You deserve to be dead after what you did! You hear me? Okay. Im giving you a chance. No one ever gave me a chance. Now, ever since I was a child, Ive always loved little puzzles. For me, they are a retreat from the horrors of our world. Maybe they can bring some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson. You want me to do puzzles? Three riddles in two minutes. You give me the answers, and Ill give you the code for the lock.  Do you understand?  Yeah. Okay, okay. So I just... You want me to... Riddle number one... It can be cruel, poetic, or blind, but when its denied, its violence you may find. Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that? Cruel? Poetic?  Justice.  Huh? The answers justice.  Justice?  Yes!  Oh, God.  Justice! And you were supposed to be an arm of justice in this city, along with the late mayor and police commissioner, were you not, Mr. Colson? Of course, of course. Of course. Riddle number two. If you are justice, please do not lie. What is the price for your blind eye?  The price?  Bribes. Oh, God. Bribes? Hes asking you how much it cost for you to turn your back. Fiftyeight seconds!  How much?  Nothing!  How much?  Ten grand. Ten Gs a month. I get a monthly payment just not to prosecute certain cases. What cases? He didnt ask me that! Come on! Ten grand.  Thats my answer. Its ten grand!  Okay. Okay. Okay. Dont lose your head, Mr. Colson. Just one more to go before your time runs out. Last riddle. Since your justice is so select, please tell us which vermin youre paid to protect.  Which vermin?  The rat. The informant you all protect from the Salvatore Maroni case.  How do you know about that?  Whats his name? Twenty seconds.  No.  Hes gonna kill you. Im a dead man either way. Youre talking to a dead man, okay? If I go out this way, its just me. But if I give over that name, I have family, people I love.  Hell kill them too.  Who will?  People are watching.  What people? Its so much bigger than you could ever imagine.  Its the whole system!  Five! Four!  Oh, God, have mercy on me...  Three! Goodbye! Who do you think he is under there? Take it easy. I want to see. What is that thing? Leather? Whats he got on his eyes? Who cares? I want to see his face. What are we doing here? Lets just take it off... Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Relax, God damn it! Youre protecting this guy, Jim? He interfered in an active hostage situation. Colsons blood is on his hands. Maybe its on yours. Whatd you say? He would rather die than talk. What was he afraid of? You? You son of a bitch. You have any idea what kind of trouble youre in? You could be an accessory to murder. Why are we playing games... Get him! Come on! Back off! Back off! Great, now I got you on assaulting an officer!  You got me on assaulting three.  Hey! Whats the matter with you? This isnt the way to do this! You too now? Let me handle this, Chief. Just give me a minute. Youre gonna put yourself on the line for this scumbag, Jim? Just give me a minute. Ill get him to cooperate. Okay, give him the room. Two minutes. You listen to me. We gotta get you out of here. That would put a lot of heat on you. Well, you punched me in the face. Take this key. Through that door. Hallway to the stairs that go to the roof. Hey, what the hell is going on here? Hey, hey, hey, whats going on? Whos the mustache with the broken nose? Thats Kenzie. Narcotics. Hes one of the guys I got into it with at the Iceberg Lounge. What are you saying? Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin? Or he moonlights as a cop.  Jesus Christ!  Go! Somebody stop him!  There he is!  Freeze! Could have at least pulled that punch, man. I did. Bock put out an APB on you. You really think hes in on this? I dont trust any of em. Do you? I only trust you. Whats a narcotics cop doing with Falcones righthand man? Colson said, Cops protect the rat. Maybe Kenzies part of it. You think Penguins the rat? His club caters to the mob. Maroni practically lived there. Penguin would have been privy to a lot of dirt. DA was a regular too. Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam and working a deal was his only way out. The Rata Alada. The what? Riddlers latest. The cipher in the maze. It means a rat with wings. Like a stool pigeon. A penguins got wings too. Time for me to have another conversation with him. What about the Riddler? Hes gonna kill again. Its all connected. Like it or not, its his game now. You want to find Riddler, we gotta find that rat. Kenzie and the twins, coming your way. Theres Penguin. I wonder whats in the bags. You want to move in? Lets follow. They stopped at Waterfront Street. The recycling plant. Im here.  How you doing?  Yeah, good. How are you? Good, good. Lets get in out of this deluge. Its a drug lab. Drops. This is a buy. Looks like they got Maronis operation up and running again. Or they never shut it down at all. What are you saying? The biggest drug bust in GCPD history was a fraud? This just got complicated. What do you mean? Hey! What happened? You all right? Dangerous crowd youre stealing from. Jesus. Is this how you get your kicks, hon? Sneaking up on girls in the dark? Is that why you work in the club? It was all just a score? I would love to sit and go over every gory detail with you, bat boy... but, uh, those assholes are coming back. Jesus! Hey, Vengeance! You think you can come after my money, huh? Kenzie! Get the money! Hey! What the... Whoa! Come on! Come on! This guys crazy! Come on! Hey! Move! Get out of the way! Come on! Get out of the way! I got you! I got you! Take that, you friggin psycho! I got you! What the hell is this? Good cop, batshit cop?  Whos the Riddler?  Riddler? How should I know? Lets make it easy for you, Oz. Cops caught you doing something. They were gonna shut you down, put you away. So you gave up a bigger fish to save your ass. You ratted out Salvatore Maroni. His drops operation. But the cops, the city officials, the mayor, the DA, they got greedy, right? Wasnt enough, a big careermaking bust. They wanted to take over the drops business too, but they needed a minor league mope like you to run it. You dont just work for Carmine Falcone. You work for them too. What are you, crazy? That why you killed the girl? I didnt kill no girl! We know she worked for you at the 44 Below. But she got too close, right? Found out from Mitchell that you were the rat, so you killed her. But somehow Riddler found out too. He knows so much about you.  You must know about him.  Who is he? Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here. Why dont you start harmonizing? Theres only one problem with your little scenario, okay? I aint no rat! You got any idea what Carmine Falcone would do to me if he heard this kind of talk? Oh, you dont wanna talk about rats, huh? Maybe we can talk about what they did to my partners face. Holy God, what are you showing me here?  This was around his head!  Come on! Open your eyes! Are you El Rata Alada? El Rata Alada? Yeah, a rat with wings. A stool pigeon. Thats not you? The symbols in the maze, right here. It says you are El Rata Alada. You are El Rata? It says that? Why, you got something to tell us? Yeah! Its, like, the worst Spanish I ever heard. What? Its La. La rata. What, is this Riddler stupid or something? Jesus! Look at you two. Worlds greatest detectives! Am I the only here knows the difference between el and la? Jesus! No habla espaol, fellas? Do me a favor, shithead, shut up! You think he made a mistake? He doesnt make mistakes. A rat with wings? You know what that sounds like to me? A friggin bat! Huh? You ever think of that? You are El Rata. You are el. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe he isnt as smart as... Wait. Is that him? Holy shit. What the hell does that mean? Is he or isnt he? I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed. But in a mansion, in a slum, Ill never know where I come from. Do you know what I am? Any idea? Yeah. Its an orphan. A mansion in a slum.  Hes talking about the old orphanage.  The one that burned down? It was part of the Wayne estate. They donated it after they built the tower. Lets go. You guys realize Im still here, right? You gonna untie me? How the hell am I supposed to get out of here? Hey! You goddamn sons of bitches! No guns. Yeah, man. Thats your thing. Whats that? Hey! Hey! Dropheads. What the hell is that? Thank you. Thank you so much. Wasnt that beautiful? Thank you all. Thank you, uh... Thank you for coming today. I believe in Gotham. I believe in its promise. But too many have been left behind for too long, and thats why Im here today. To announce, not only my candidacy for mayor, but also the creation of the Gotham Renewal Fund. Win or lose, the Wayne Foundation pledges a 1 billion donation to start a charitable endowment for public works. I want to bypass political gridlock, and get money to people and projects who need it now, like these children behind me. Sins of the father. Renewal is about growth. It is about planting seeds... ...and renewing Gothams promise. Shall be visited upon the son. Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne. Hey!  Hello?  Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!  Oh, Mr. Wayne...  Listen to me! Something terrible is gonna happen! Im afraid it already has, sir. About an hour ago. Im so sorry. Ive been trying to reach you. The package was intended for you. It was a C4 explosive sent in a mailer. We found this too. Weve sedated him. We just have to hope he stabilizes. You should go home, Mr. Wayne. Get some sleep. Is there anyone else to notify? Next of kin? No. Its just me. Selina? Can you see me?  Yeah, I can see you.  I need to talk to you. Where can we go? Cat burglar pulling another score?  What?  Wasnt sure Id see you again. Yeah, well, things were getting a little hot for me, so... How could they do that to her? That piece of shit cop, Kenzie. Her body was in his car. Im gonna find him and Im gonna make him pay. You gonna help me?  Help you?  Yeah. I thought you were Vengeance. Your friend got involved with the wrong people. She didnt know any better. Maybe you should have explained it to her. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means your choices have consequences. Jesus Christ. Choices? You know, whoever the hell you are, you obviously grew up rich.  Was it worth it?  What? Compromising yourself for money? What did you have to do to set up that score? How close did you have to get to Penguin? To Falcone? You dont know what the hell youre talking about. Falcone owes me that money.  He owes you?  Yeah, and a lot more. Oh, really? Whys that? You know what? I cant even talk to you. No! I want to know why a guy like Falcone would owe you anything. Because hes my father! My mother worked at the 44 Below. Just like Anni. She used to take me there when I was a little girl. To the club? Yeah. I hid out in the dressing room while she worked. Used to see him there. He scared the shit out of me. And I could never understand why he looked at me the way he did. Then one night, my mother told me who he was. When I was seven, my mother was murdered. Strangled. Never found out who. Probably some creep from the club. Anyway, social services came to take me away, and he didnt say a thing. Couldnt even look at me. He owes me that money. Im sorry. For what I said. Oh, its all right. You assume the worst in people. Which, well... maybe were not so different after all. Who are you under there? What are you hiding? Are you just... hideously scarred? Yeah. Listen to me. If we dont stand up for Annika, no one will. All anyone cares about in this place are these white, privileged assholes. The mayor, the commissioner, the DA. Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne. I mean, as far as Im concerned, that psychos right to go after these creeps. I think youd be on his side. What do you mean, Thomas and Bruce Wayne? What, do you live in a cave? The Riddlers latest. Its all about the Waynes. Listen, if I can find that dickbag Kenzie, will you help me? Please. Come on, Vengeance. Just dont make any moves without me, understand? Its a little more dangerous than you know... I told you, baby. I can take care of myself. Im Thomas Wayne, and I approve this message. From a very young age, my family, Marthas family, the Arkhams... ...instilled in both of us that giving back is not just an obligation, its a passion. That is our familys legacy. The Waynes and the Arkhams. Gothams founding families. But what is their real legacy? Twenty years ago, one reporter set out to uncover the dark truth. He found shocking family secrets. How, when Martha was just a child, her mother brutally murdered her father, then committed suicide... ...and how the Arkhams used their power and money to cover it up. How Martha herself was in and out of institutions for years and they didnt want anyone to know. Thomas Wayne tried to force this crusading reporter into a hushmoney agreement to save his mayoral campaign. But when the reporter refused... ...Wayne turned to longtime secret associate Carmine Falcone and had him murdered! The Waynes and the Arkhams, Gothams legacy of lies and murder. I hope youre listening, Bruce Wayne. This is your legacy too. And Gotham needs you to answer for the sins of your father. Goodbye. Do you know who I am? Youre Bruce Wayne. I wanna see Carmine Falcone. See? Who is this guy who invented the ball, right? Must have made a fortune. If you think about it, the concept of it, right? Briscoe, do you know how much this sweater cost? No, boss. 1,183. You know why communism failed, right? No, boss. Austerity. All right. All right. Look at that. Perfect. Its never gonna be that good again. Hey, Johnny Slick. What are you doing here? Give us a moment here, fellas. Come on. See ya, champ. Come on, sweetheart. Have a seat. I thought I might hear from you. This, uh, Riddler son of a bitch is really... stirring things up, huh?  Is it true?  What? That reporter business? What do you want to know here, kid? Did you kill him? For my father? Look, your father was in trouble. This reporter had some dirt. Some very... personal stuff about your mother, her family history. Everybodys got their dirty laundry, thats just how it is. But he didnt want none of it coming out, not right before the election. And your father tried to pay the guy off, but he wasnt going for it. So, he came to me. Well, I never seen him like that. He said, Carmine, I want you to put the fear of God in this guy. And when fear isnt enough... Oof. Hmm. Your father wanted me to handle it, so I did. I handled it. I know. You thought your father was a Boy Scout. But youd be surprised what even a good man like him is capable of in the right situation. Do me a favor. Dont lose any sleep over it. This reporter was a lowlife. He was on Maronis payroll.  Maroni?  Oh, yeah. He could never stand your father and I had history. And after what happened with that reporter, Maroni was worried that your father would be in my pocket, forever. He would have done anything to keep him from becoming mayor. You understand? Are you saying Salvatore Maroni got my father killed? Do I know it for a fact? Im just saying, it sure looked that way to me. This is what you wanted, huh? This little conversation here? Its been a long time coming, huh? I mean, you aint a kid no more. You lied to me... my whole life. I spoke to Carmine Falcone. He told me what he did for my father. About Salvatore Maroni. He told you Salvatore Maroni... Had my father killed. Why didnt you tell me all this? All these years Ive spent fighting for him, believing that he was a good man. He was a good man. You listen to me. Your father was a good man.  He made a mistake.  A mistake. He had a man killed. Why? To protect his family image? His political aspirations? It wasnt to protect the family image, and he didnt have anyone killed. He was protecting your mother. He didnt care about his image or the campaign, any of that. He cared about her, and you, and in a moment of weakness, he turned to Falcone. But he never thought Falcone would kill that man. Your father should have known that Falcone would do anything to finally have something on him that he could use. Thats who Falcone is. And that was your fathers mistake. But when Falcone told him what hed done, your father was distraught. He told Falcone he was going to the police, that he would confess everything. And that night, your father and your mother were killed. It was Falcone? Oh, I wish I knew for sure. Or maybe it was some random thug on the street who needed money, got scared, and pulled the trigger too fast. If you dont think Ive spent every day searching for that answer... It was my job to protect them. Do you understand? I know you always blamed yourself. You were only a boy, Bruce. I could see the fear in your eyes, but I didnt know how to help. I could teach you how to fight, but I wasnt equipped to take care of you. You needed a father. And all you had was me. Im sorry. Dont be sorry, Alfred. God. I never thought Id feel fear like that again. I thought Id mastered all that. I mean, Im not afraid to die. I realize now theres something I havent got past. This fear... of ever going through any of that again. Of losing somebody I care about. Hey. I saw the signal. Thats not you? I thought it was you.  I found him!  I see that. He had my shit and my phone. She left a message the night they took her. She called me... Gordon! Help me out, man! She got my gun!  Shut up!  Put the gun down. Im telling you, God damn it! She called me! Here. Listen. Hey! Get back here! Where you going? Come back here! Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie? Youre scaring her. Im sorry, Mr. Falcone. Please, please, please. Please, dont hurt me, please. Hey, dont be scared. Come here. Now let me ask you again.  What did Mitchell tell you?  No, nothing. He... Don liked to talk. I know that. Especially to pretty girls like you. Thats why I made him take your passport... until we could have this little conversation. All I want to do is get out of here, okay? Youll never hear from me again, nobody will. Please, please... Were gonna get you out of here, I promise. But first, I gotta know... What did he tell you? He just said they all made a deal with you. Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh? The deal. He said you gave some information on some drops thing and thats how he became mayor. He said you were a very important man. Right. Mmhmm. Hmm. Okay. Just take it easy. Jesus, hes strangling her. Take it easy. Rata Alada. A falcon has wings too. Falcone is the rat? Falcone works for you guys? The mayor? The DA? No. We work for him. Everybody does. How? Through Renewal. Renewal is everything.  The Renewal Fund?  Yeah. After Thomas Wayne died, they all went after it like vultures. The mayor, Falcone, Maroni. Everyone got in on it. It was perfect for making bribes, laundering money. A huge charitable fund with no oversight. Everybody got a piece. But Falcone wanted more. So he orchestrated a play to take Maroni down big. Hed rat out his drops operation, make the careers of everybody that went after him, then install them all as his puppets. You think this goddamn election matters? Falcones the mayor. Hes been the mayor for the last 20 years. Come on, Vengeance. Lets go kill that son of a bitch.  This creep too. Lets finish this.  Oh, God! No! Well get him.  But not that way.  There is no other way! He owns the city! Cross that line... youll become just like him. Listen to me. Dont throw your life away. Dont worry, honey. I got nine of em. No, dont! Hey, hey! Oh, God! She wont get out of there alive. And if she kills Falcone, we may never find the Riddler. I have to stop her. Dont you mean we? I gotta do this my way. And then what? We do what Riddler said. Bring the rat into the light. Can you tell Mr. Falcone Id like to come up? He aint seein nobody tonight. Tell him its about Annika. Hey! Look who it is, huh?  Sorry to bother you.  Nah. Its fine, beautiful. I was just hoping I could talk to you for a minute? Absolutely. Alone? Hey! Im just so worried. I dont know where she is. And I know that youre a very important man. I was hoping that maybe you could help me find her... because shes been gone so long, Im beginning to... Im sorry. Its okay.  Im so sorry.  I understand. Here. No, thats okay, I have a tissue. Mr. Falcone? Vinnie! Didnt I tell you? Im sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think youre gonna want to see this. Im sorry, beautiful. Ill be right back. Holy shit. That recording, provided to GC1 by Lieutenant James Gordon of the Gotham PD. And we should warn you, the contents are extremely graphic and some of you may find it disturbing. He just said they all made a deal with you. Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh? The deal. He said you gave some information on some drops thing and thats how he became mayor. He said you were a very important man. Right. Hmm. Okay. Revelations of Mr. Falcones secret role as a mafia informant... Hey, Dad. What? Im Maria Kyles kid. You remember her? Yeah. Just put down the gun, honey. This is for my mother. I see him! You dont think this hurts me? My own flesh and blood, huh? You made me do this. Just like your mother. He has to pay! You dont have to pay with him. You paid enough. Jesus. Look at you, man. What do you think this is? You think youre gonna scare me with that mask and that cape? Im gonna start crying, and all of a sudden, some big secrets comin out? Let me tell you something. Whatever I know, whatever Ive done, its all going with me to my grave. What, are you with Zorro over here? Dont you know you boys in blue work for me? I guess we dont all work for you. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, the City of Gotham will provide one to you. Do you understand these rights? Do you understand? Yeah. Ill see you when I walk out. With these rights in mind, is there anything else you wish to tell... Goddamn rat. Whatd you say? Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine. Probably be your last. Ohho. So youre a big man now, Oz? Maybe I am. Really, Oz? Because to me, you were always just a gimp in an empty suit. Ill spray paint your ass! What are you doing? It wasnt me! I didnt shoot! I didnt shoot! Get your hands off of me! Bring him into the light. And youll find where Im at. There! The shots came from up there! Its Riddler. Gage, on me. Martinez, around back. Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out! Hes gone. Hes been here this whole time.  Lieutenant. Martinez.  Yeah? Lieutenant, we got a witness here, says she saw someone coming down the fire escape right after the shot. She said he went into the corner diner. The guys sitting by himself at the counter, right now. Police! Hands up! He said put your goddamn hands up, you son of a bitch. I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie. Stay still! Now! Which one is you? You tell me. Lets go, pencilneck. Get that son of a bitch out of here! ...where even murdered mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.s wife and son have gathered in an emotional show of city unity. Our Dan ONeil is live inside Rels headquarters right now... Hey. What are all these diaries? Theyre ledgers. Hes got thousands. He scrawled all over em. Rambling, ciphers, codes. Got something back on one of the IDs. Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.  Hes a forensic accountant.  Accountant? Hey, Lieutenant! You really okay with this? What about chain of evidence? You should see this. Hes wearing gloves. Friday, July 16th. My life has been a cruel riddle I could not solve, suffocating my mind, no escape. But then, today, I saw it. A single word on this ledger, sitting on the desk beside me. Renewal. The empty promise they sold to me as a child in that orphanage. One look inside, and finally I understood. My whole life has been preparing me for this. The moment when I would learn the truth. When I could finally strike back and expose their lies. If you want people to understand, really understand, you cant just give them the answers. You have to confront them, torture them with the horrifying questions, just like they tortured me. I know now what I must become. Jesus. I dont think that rat likes you, man. This ones not a rat. What is that? Some kind of pry tool? Is it a chisel? Its a murder weapon. He killed Mitchell with it. The edge will match the floorboard impression in the mayors study. My confession? Whats he confessing to? He already told us he killed Mitchell. This isnt over. Oh, man. Hes been posting all kinds of shit online. Hes got, like, 500 followers. Real fringe types. His final post was last night. Some video. Got a lot of views, but its passwordprotected.  Can you get in?  Copying his drive now. Take some time, but well get in.  Show me the post.  Its right here. The Truth Unmasked. I think Im his last target. You? Maybe this is all coming to an end. What is? The Batman. Yeah? Right. Riddlers asking for you. At Arkham. Youre a good cop. I told you Id see you in hell. What do you want from me? Want? If only you knew how long Ive been waiting for this day. For this moment. Ive been invisible my whole life. I guess I wont be anymore, will I? Theyll remember me now. Theyll remember both of us. Bruce... Wayne. Bruce... Wayne. You know, I was there that day. The day the great Thomas Wayne announced he was running for mayor, made all those promises. Well, a week later he was dead, and everybody just forgot about us. All they could talk about was poor Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne, the orphan. Orphan. Living in some tower over the park isnt being an orphan. Looking down on everyone, with all that money. Dont you tell me. Do you know what being an orphan is? Its 30 kids to a room. Twelve years old and already a drophead, numbing the pain. You wake up screaming with rats chewing your fingers. And every winter one of the babies die because its so cold. But, oh, no. Lets talk about the billionaire with the lying, dead daddy because at least the money makes it go down easy. Doesnt it? Bruce... Wayne. Hes the only one we didnt get. But we got the rest of em, didnt we? All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks. God. Look at you. Your mask is amazing. I wish you couldve seen me in mine. Aint it funny? All everyone wants to do is unmask you, but theyre missing the point. You and I both know Im looking at the real you right now. My mask allowed me to be myself completely. No shame, no limits. Why did you write me? What do you mean? All those cards. I told you, weve been doing this together. Youre a part of this.  We didnt do anything together.  We did. What did we just do? I asked you to bring him into the light, and you did. Were such a good team. Were not a team. I never could have gotten him out of there. Im not physical. My strength is up here. I mean, I had all the pieces, I had the answers. But I didnt know how to make them listen. You gave me that. I gave you nothing. You showed me what was possible. You showed me all it takes is fear and a little focused violence. You inspired me. Youre out of your goddamn mind. What? This is all in your head. Youre sick, twisted. How can you say that? You think youll be remembered? Youre a pathetic psychopath,  begging for attention.  No.  Youre gonna die alone in Arkham.  No. No, no! A nobody! No! Ahhh! This is not how this was supposed to go! Ahhh! I had it all planned out! We were gonna be safe here. We could watch the whole thing together. Watch what? Everything! It was all there. You mean, you didnt figure it out? Oh, youre really not as smart as I thought you were. I guess I gave you too much credit. What have you done? Whats black and blue and dead all over? You. If you think you can stop whats coming... What have you done? Ave Maria What have you done? Gratia plena What have you done? Maria Gratia plena Hey! What are you doing in here? Hey, man, I dont think that you should be touching that. Boy, this guys a real nutjob, huh? Killing Mitchell with a friggin carpet tool. My uncles a... Hes an installer. You know, its a... Oh, you know. Its a tucker. Huh. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, guys. Uh, thanks for all the comments and a special thanks to everyone for the tips on detonators. Detonators? I just want to say this will be my last post for a little while, and, uh... what this community has meant to me these weeks, these months, lets just say none of us... is alone anymore. Okay? Jesus. Tomorrows Election Day. And Bella Rel will win. She promised real change. But we know the truth, dont we? Youve seen Gothams true face now. Together, weve unmasked it. Its corruption, its perversion masquerading under the guise of renewal. But unmasking is not enough. The day of judgment is finally upon us. And now it is time for retribution. Ive parked seven vans all along the city seawall. And on the big night, they will go boom. Boom! Boom! When the vans blow, the flooding will happen so fast, evacuation will not be an option. Those who are not washed away will race through the streets in terror. Call Gordon. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. As breaking news hits higher ground in Gotham Square Garden... ...celebrations will turn to panic, as the venue becomes the citys shelter of last resort. And thats where all of you come in. Now, when the time arrives, I will already be unmasked. The pigs will have me in their custody, but thats okay. Because then it will be your turn. Youll be there, waiting. Its time for the lies to finally end. False promises of renewal? Change? Well give them real, real change now. Weve spent our lives in this wretched place, suffering! Wondering, Why us? Now they will spend their last moments wondering, why them? I cant get through! The lines are down. Hey, hey, hey! Roads closed! Im just trying to get out of town, man! Lady, we got bombs going off. The whole citys flooding. Youre gonna have to go inside the Garden with everyone else.  Lieutenant, whos in charge?  I really dont know. Were just trying to get a handle here, sir. Right. Hey, listen! Quiet! We got an active situation. We need to sweep the building for explosives and get the mayorelect out of here, now.  Where is she?  I can take you there. Come!  If we dont close the doors...  MCU. ...were gonna have huge problems. The waters already started to breach. I thought this was a shelter of last resort. Yeah, for a hurricane, but not if the whole seawall comes down. I am not gonna let those people die out there. All right. Ill go calm down the crowd so we can get everyone in. Its not safe for you here. We need to get you out, Ms. Rel.  Im not going anywhere.  Were under attack, maam. Exactly! Thats the problem with this city. Everyones afraid to stand up and do the right thing, but Im not.  Excuse me.  Maam... Everyone, everyone, if I could just get your attention. Please! I just need your attention! Youre okay! Hey! Hey! How do I get up there? Follow me, sir. No, no. Its okay. Its okay. Its okay. Its done now. Its done. Its over. Hey! Hey, man, take it easy! Take it easy. Easy. Jesus. Who the hell are you? Me? Im Vengeance. Wednesday, November 6th. The city is underwater. The National Guard is coming. Martial law is in effect... but the criminal element never sleeps. Looting and lawlessness will be rampant in the parts of the city no one can get to. I can already see things will get worse before they get better. And some will seize the chance to grab everything they can. We will rebuild. But not just our city. We must rebuild peoples faith in our institutions, in our elected officials, in each other. Together, we will learn to believe in Gotham again. Im starting to see now. I have had an effect here... but not the one I intended. Vengeance wont change the past, mine or anyone elses. I have to become more. People need hope. To know someones out there for them. The citys angry, scarred, like me. Our scars can destroy us. Even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure... and the strength to fight. We are live. As you can see, the masked vigilante atop Gotham Square Garden helping to save the lives of hundreds of victims. And now as first responders desperately scramble to help the injured, a mysterious masked man emerges, heroically pulling the victims right through that skylight... Isnt that just terrible? Him... raining on your parade like that? What is it they say? One day youre on top, the next... youre a clown. Well, let me tell you, there are worse things to be. Hey, hey, hey. Dont be sad. You did so well. And you know, Gotham loves a comeback story. Who are you? Well, thats the question, isnt it? Riddle me this... The less of them you have, the more one is worth. A friend. Youre leaving. Jesus. Dont you ever just say hello? Where will you go? I dont know. Upstate. Bludhaven, maybe. Why? You asking me to stay? You know this place is never gonna change. With Carmine gone, its only gonna get worse for you. Theres gonna be a power grab. Itll be bloody. I know. But the city can change. It wont. I have to try. Its gonna kill you eventually. You know that. Listen. Why dont you come with me? Get into some trouble. Knock off some CEO hedge fund types. Itll be fun. The bat and the cat. Its got a nice ring. Who am I kidding? Youre already spoken for. You should go. Selina... Take care of yourself. Rachel, let me see.  Can l see?  Finders keepers. And l found it. ln my garden. Finders keepers. Bruce? Bruce? Mom! Mr. Alfred! Did you have dream? Nightmare. Worse than this place? They are going to fight you.  Again?  Until they kill you. Can they kill me before breakfast? You are in hell, little man. And l am the devil. Youre not the devil. Youre practice. Solitary.  Why?  For protection.  l dont need protection.  Protection for them. Get in. Are you so desperate to fight criminals... ...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time? Actually, there were seven of them. l counted six, Mr. Wayne. How do you know my name? The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear... ...no matter how deep he chooses to sink. Who are you? My name is merely Ducard, but l speak for Ras al Ghul... ...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A man who can offer you a path. What makes you think l need a path? Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity... ...but whatever your original intentions... ...you have become truly lost. And what path can Ras al Ghul offer? The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil... ...and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows.  Youre vigilantes.  No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man... ...if you devote yourself to an ideal... ...and if they cant stop you... ...then you become something else entirely. Which is? Legend, Mr. Wayne. Tomorrow, you will be released. lf you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something... ...there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. lf you can carry it to the top of the mountain... ...you may find what you were looking for in the first place. And what was l looking for? Only you can know that. You turn back. You go back. Ras al Ghul? Wait. What are you seeking? l seek... ...the means to fight injustice. To turn fear... ...against those who prey on the fearful. To manipulate the fears in others... ...you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin? l can... l can barely stand. Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate or fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. Youre skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us, Mr. Wayne... ...what do you fear? Bruce? lts okay. lts okay. Youll be okay. Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne? No, lll set the bone and take him for an xray later. Very good, sir. lm very sorry, sir. lve told... Dont worry. lts fine. Took quite a fall, didnt we, Master Bruce? And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. Just a little fall. lts just a small fracture. The bats again? You know why they attacked you, dont you?  They were afraid of you.  Afraid of me? All creatures feel fear. Even the scary ones? Especially the scary ones. l got something to show you.  You think your mother will like them?  Yeah. l think its time to get up.  Maybe. No going back to bed. Did you build this train, Dad? Gothams been good to our family, but the citys been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center... ...Wayne Tower. Is that where you work?  No, l work at the hospital. l leave the running of our company to much better men.  Better?  Well... ...more interested men. Can we go? Please. Okay. Lets go.  Whats wrong, Bruce?  No, no. lt was me. l just needed some fresh air. A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce? Come on. Lets go. Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast. Thats fine. Fast. Take it easy. Take it easy. Here you go. lts fine. lts fine. Now just take it and go.  l said, jewelry. Hey... Thomas! Bruce. lts okay. Dont be afraid. ls this your fathers? lts okay. Come here. There you go. lts okay. lts okay. Gordon. Hey. Good news. We got him, son. Youre in excellent hands. Well be watching the empire. When you grow up, itll be waiting for you. l thought l might prepare a little supper.  Very well.  Alfred?  Yes, Master Bruce?  lt was my fault, Alfred.  l made them leave the theater.  No.  lf l hadnt gotten scared...  lt was nothing that you did. lt was him, and him alone. Do you understand? l miss them, Alfred. l miss them so much. So do l, Master Bruce. So do l. And do you still feel responsible for your parents death? My anger outweighs my guilt. Come. You have learned to bury your guilt with anger. l will teach you to confront it and to face the truth. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600. You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible. lnvisible? The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility. Always mind your surroundings. Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.  As weapons?  Or distractions. Theatricality and deception are powerful agents. You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent. Who is he?  He was a farmer. Then he tried to take his neighbors land and became a murderer.  Now he is a prisoner.  Whatll happen to him? Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated. Criminals thrive on the indulgence of societys understanding. Your parents death was not your fault. lt was your fathers. Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.  The man had a gun.  Would that stop you? lve had training. The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act. Yield. You havent beaten me. You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke. Rub your chest. Your arms will take care of themselves. You are stronger than your father. You didnt know my father. But l know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangling the grief... ...until the memory of your loved one is just... ...poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed... ...so youd be spared your pain. l wasnt always here in the mountains. Once, l had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me. Like you, l was forced to learn there are those without decency... ...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity. Your anger gives you great power. But if you let it, it will destroy you... ...as it almost did me.  What stopped it?  Vengeance. Thats no help to me. Why, Bruce? Why could you not avenge your parents? Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir... ...or can l persuade you to stay on for a day or two? lm not heading back at all. You dont like it there?  l like it fine. They just dont feel the same way.  lve prepared the master bedroom.  No. My room will be fine. With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house. No, Alfred, its my fathers house.  Your father is dead.  This place is a mausoleum. lf l have my way, lll pull the damn thing down brick by brick. This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family. Why do you give a damn, Alfred? lts not your family. l give a damn because a good man once made me responsible... ...for what was most precious to him... ...in the whole world. Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing. She probably hopes to talk you out of going. Should l just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred? l wouldnt presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir. Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future. Havent given up on me yet? Never. Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf. Hasnt he noticed youre tall enough to reach now? Old habits die hard, l guess.  Never used to stop us anyway.  No, it didnt. Hows your mom? She misses this place. So do l. Yeah. But its nothing without the people who made it what it was.  Now theres only Alfred.  And you.  lm not staying, Rachel.  Youre just back for the hearing. Bruce, l dont suppose theres any way to convince you not to come. Someone at this proceeding... ...should stand for my parents. We all loved your parents, Bruce.  What Chill did is unforgivable.  Then why is your boss letting him go? ln prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone. He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole. Rachel, this man killed my parents. l cannot let that pass. And l need you to understand that, please. Okay. The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all. His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed... ...but by desperation. Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation... ...with one of this offices most important investigations... ...we strongly endorse his petition for early release. Mr. Chill? Your Honor... ...not a day goes by that l dont wish l could take back what l did. Sure, l was desperate, like a lot of people back then... ...but that dont change what l did. l gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today. Has he got anything to say? Joe! Hey, Joe! Falcone says hi. Come on, Bruce. We dont need to see this. l do. The DA couldnt understand why Judge Faden insisted... ...on making the hearing public. Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open. Maybe l should thank them.  You dont mean that.  What if l do, Rachel? My parents deserved justice. Youre not talking about justice. Youre talking about revenge.  Sometimes, theyre the same.  No, theyre never the same. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.  lts why we have an impartial system.  Your system is broken. You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting. They talk about the depression as if its history. lts not. Things are worse than ever here. Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs... ...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day. Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce... ...but hes destroying everything that they stood for. You wanna thank him for that? Here you go. We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich... ...and the good people scared, no onell touch him. Good people like your parents, wholl stand against injustice, theyre gone. What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?  lm not one of your good people, Rachel.  What do you mean? All these years, l wanted to kill him. Now l cant. Your father would be ashamed of you. Youre taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne. No gun? lm insulted.  You couldve just sent a thankyou note.  l didnt come here to thank you. l came to show you that not everyone in Gothams afraid of you. Only those who know me, kid. Look around you. Youll see two councilmen... ...a union official, couple offduty cops... ...and a judge. l wouldnt have a seconds hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, thats power you cant buy. Thats the power of fear. lm not afraid of you. Because you think you got nothing to lose. But you havent thought it through. You havent thought about your lady friend in the DAs office. You havent thought about your old butler. Bang! People from your world... ...have so much to lose. Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot... ...you know about the ugly side of life, but you dont. Youve never tasted desperate. Youre... Youre Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham. Youd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didnt know your name. So dont come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself. This is a world youll never understand. And you always fear... ...what you dont understand. All right. Yeah, you got spirit, kid. lll give you that. More than your old man anyway. ln the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents. He said your father begged for mercy. Begged. Like a dog. Shouldve tipped better.  For what?  Your jacket. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. lts a nice coat. Be careful who sees you with that.  Theyre gonna come looking for me.  Who? Everyone. lts... lts a nice coat. When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them? The first time I stole so that I wouldn t starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled... ... I learned the fear before a crime... ... and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Fool. What do l care what your name is? Youre a criminal. Tell that to the guy who owned these. Youve traveled the world to understand the criminal mind... ...and conquer your fears. But a criminal is not complicated. And what you really fear is inside yourself. You fear your own power. You fear your anger... ...the drive to do great or terrible things. Now you must journey inwards. You are ready. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness. Focus. Concentrate. Master your senses. You cannot leave any sign. l havent. lmpressive. We have purged your fear. You are ready to lead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice. lm no executioner. Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share. Thats why its so important. lt separates us from them. You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.  This man should be tried. By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats? Criminals mock societys laws. You know this better than most. You cannot lead these men... ...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil. And where would l be leading these men? Gotham. As Gothams favored son... ...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.  How?  Gothams time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it... ...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. lt is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. lt is one weve performed for centuries. Gotham... ...must be destroyed. You cant believe in this. Ras al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts. What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary. l will go back to Gotham and l will fight men like this... ...but l will not become an executioner. Bruce, please. For your own sake, there is no turning back.  What are you doing?  Whats necessary, my friend. l will tell him you saved his life. Master Wayne, youve been gone a long time.  Yes, l have.  You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir? As long as it takes. l want to show the people... ...their city doesnt belong to the criminals and the corrupt. ln the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises... ...combating poverty. He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city. Did it? ln a way. Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action. People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy. l cant do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man... ...lm flesh and blood, l can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol... As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.  l can be everlasting.  What symbol? Something elemental... ...something terrifying. l assume that as you take on the underworld... ...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals? Youre thinking about Rachel? Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself. Have you told anyone lm coming back? l couldnt figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.  Dead?  Youve been gone seven years. You had me declared dead? Actually, it was Mr. Earle. Hes taking the company public. He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding. Those shares are worth quite a bit of money. Well, its a good thing l left everything to you, then. Quite so, sir. And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank. ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others... ...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.  Dr. Crane.  Miss Dawes. You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesnt belong in jail? l would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l? This is the third of Falcones thugs youve had declared insane... ...and moved into your asylum. The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane. Or the corrupt. Mr. Finch. I think you should check with Miss Dawes here... ...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. lf any.  What are you doing?  What are you doing, Carl? Looking out for you. Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.  Drop it.  How can you say that? Because as much as l care about getting Falcone, l care more about you. Thats sweet. Weve been through all that. Blessed bat again, sir. They nest somewhere in the grounds. No more favors. Someone is sniffing around. Hey, l scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc. lm bringing in the shipments. We are paying you for that. Maybe money isnt as interesting to me as favors. l am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone. But you know who lm working for, and when he gets here... He... Hes coming to Gotham? Yes, he is. And when he gets here, hes not going to wanna hear... ...that youve endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time.  Whos bothering you?  Theres a girl at the DAs office.  Well buy her off.  Not this one. ldealist, huh? Well, theres an answer to that too.  l dont want to know.  Yes, you do. No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors. l dont think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavyarms manufacture... ...as a suitable cornerstone for our business. Well, thats 20 years ago, Fredericks. l think after 20 years we can allow ourselves... ...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done. Good morning, Mr. Earles office. Yes, hes confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening. Good morning. lm here to see Mr. Earle. Name? Bruce Wayne. Thomas would probably not have taken the company public. But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do. Jessica? Jessica? Where are you? Eye on the ball, and...  Why is no one answering the phone? lts Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. lm sure theyll call back. Bruce? Youre supposed to be dead. lm sorry to disappoint.  l need you to take a look at this.  Have you seen him yet?  Who?  Wayne. lts been all over the news. Hes back. lm sure you realize l cant stop the big machine. Too many wheels turning.  Were going public.  l understand. And lll be handsomely rewarded for my shares. lm not looking to interfere.  l am looking for a job.  Oh? l just want to get to know the company that my family built. Any ideas where you would start? Applied Sciences caught my eye. Foxs department. lll let him know youre coming. You look like him. Your dad. Youre the only one left of the Wayne family. This is where you belong. Welcome home. Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products. All prototypes. None in production.  On any level whatsoever.  None? What did they tell you this place was? They didnt tell me anything. Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here. Dead end. Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble. Come on.  You were on the board?  When your father ran things.  You knew my father?  Oh, yeah. Helped him build his train. Here we are. Kevlar utility harness. Gaspowered, magnetic grapple gun. The 350pound test monofilament. Wonderful project, your dads train. Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities. Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City. Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are. Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry. Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.  Tearresistant?  This sucker will stop a knife.  Bulletproof?  Anything but a straight shot.  Why didnt they put it into production?  Bean counters didnt think... ...a soldiers life was worth 300 grand. So, whats your interest in it, Mr. Wayne? l want to borrow it. For spelunking. Spelunking? Yeah, you know, cave diving? You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves? Look, ld rather Mr. Earle didnt know about me borrowing... Mr. Wayne... ...the way l see it... ...all this stuff is yours anyway. Okay. Give it a try. Charming. At least youll have company. This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing. In the civil war your great grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad ...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North... ...and l suspect these caverns came in handy. Alfred! Come up here! l can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you. We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore. Via a dummy corporation. lndeed. And then, quite separately... ...we place an order to a Chinese company for these.  Put it together ourselves.  Precisely. Theyll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.  How large?  Say 10,000.  Well, at least well have spares.  Yes. Dont suppose you want a taste. l just keep offering, thinking maybe someday youll get wise. Theres nothing wise in what you do, Flass. Well, Jimbo, you dont take the taste, makes us guys nervous. lm no rat. ln a town this bent, whos there to rat to anyway? Dont turn around. Youre a good cop. One of the few. What do you want? Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week. Nobody takes him down. Why? Hes paid up with the right people. What will it take to bring him down? Leverage on Judge Faden... ...and a DA brave enough to prosecute. Rachel Dawes. Who are you? Watch for my sign. Youre just one man? Now were two. We? Freeze! What the hell was that? Just some nut. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? No. Today its BASEjumping. BASEjumping.  That like parachuting?  Kind of. Do you have any lightweight fabrics? You know, l think l have just the thing. lts called memory cloth. Notice anything? Regularly flexible... ...but put a current through it... ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.  What kind of shapes can you make? Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton. Too expensive for the Army? l dont think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASEjumping crowd.  Look, Mr. Fox.  Yes, sir? lf youre uncomfortable... Mr. Wayne, if you dont want to tell me exactly what youre doing... ...when lm asked, l dont have to lie. But dont think of me as an idiot. Fair enough. Whats that? The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldnt be interested in that. She was built as a bridging vehicle. During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables. Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump... Not now! Not... Not now, sir. We never could get the damn bridge to work... ...but this baby works just fine. So, what do you think? Does it come in black? l need you at the docks Thursday.  Problems?  l dont want any trouble... ...with the last shipment.  Sure. Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DAs office.  ls that right?  And that theres a fat prize... ...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it. So, whats your point, Mr. Flass? Have you seen the girl? Its a cute little assistant D A. Don t you think thats a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?  Even for this town.  Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad. lts a problem with the graphite, sir. The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.  At least they gave us a discount.  Quite. ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest you try to avoid landing on your head? Why bats, Master Wayne? Bats frighten me. lts time my enemies shared my dread. What is this? Continue. Looks fine out there. The bears go straight to the dealers. Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.  Whats the difference?  lgnorance is bliss, my friend. Dont burden yourself with the secrets of scary people. Hey. Steiss. Steiss? What? What the...? l better check it. Theres a problem out here. You better bail. Where are you?! Here. Take a ride. Oh, shit. What the hell are you? lm Batman. Nice coat. Thanks. Hold it. Thats right, you better run. Falcone sent them to kill you.  Why?  You rattled his cage.  Whats this?  Leverage.  For what?  To get things moving. Who are you? Someone like you. Someone wholl rattle the cages. Maam? Everything okay? Falcones men?  Does it matter? Well never tie him to it anyway. l wouldnt be too sure of that. What the hell is that? Cut him down. Unacceptable. Now, l dont care if its rival gangs, Guardian Angels... ...or the goddamn Salvation Army... ...get them off the street and off the front page. They say it was just one guy. Or a creature. lt was some asshole in a costume.  Yeah?  This guy did deliver us... ...one of the citys biggest crime lords. No one takes the law into their own hands in my city. Understand? No way to bury it now. Theres still Judge Faden.  lve got Faden covered.  What about this bat they babble about? Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat... ...weve got Falcone at the scene. Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything. Okay. Lets do it.  Bats are nocturnal. Bats may be. But even for billionaire playboys, The price for leading a double life, l fear. Your theatrics made an impression. Theatricality and deception... ...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start. lf those are to be the first of many injuries to come... ...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse. Polo, for instance. lm not learning polo, Alfred. Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life. These things beg the question... ...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money. What does someone like me do? Drive sports cars, date movie stars. Buy things that are not for sale. Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun... ...you might even have a little by accident. Sir.  We have a situation.  All right. The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night... ...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead. The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. Its a microwave emitter. lts designed for desert warfare, but it... lt looks like somebody... ...turned it on. lt uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemys water supply. The damage to the ship was catastrophic. The weapon itself is... Missing? Yeah. Mr. Wayne. Nice car. You should see my other one. Hes done something the police have never have. You cant take the law into your own hands. Well, at least hes getting something done. Bruce, help me out here.  Huh? Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues. But hes put Falcone behind bars. Now the cops wanna bring him in. What does that tell you? Theyre jealous. Sir, the pool is for decoration... ...and your friends do not have swimwear. Well, theyre European. lm going to have to ask you to leave.  lt is not a question of money.  Well, you see... ...lm buying this hotel... ...and setting some new rules about the pool area. l think the Batman deserves a medal. And a straitjacket to pin it on. Thank you. Bruce? Rachel? ld heard you were back. What are you doing? Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you. You were gone a long time.  l know. How are things?  The same. Jobs getting worse. Cant change the world on your own. What choice do l have... ...when youre too busy swimming? Rachel, all of... All this... lts... lts not me. lts... lnside, l am... l am more. Come on, Bruce. Come on. Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy. Bruce... ...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be. But its not who you are underneath... ...its what you do that defines you. Dr. Crane, thanks for coming. Not at all. He cut his wrists? Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen... Of course, better safe than sorry. Yeah, Dr. Crane, l cant take it anymore. lts all too much. The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah. A couple of days of this food, itll be true.  What do you want?  l wanna know... ...how youre gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut. About what? You dont know anything. l know you dont want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized. And l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house. See, l dont go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets. And those goons you used. l own the muscle in this town. Now, lve been bringing your stuff in for months. . . . . .so whatever hes planning, its big, and l want in. Well, l already know what hell say. That we should kill you. Even he cant get me in here. Not in my town. Would you like to see my mask? l use it in my experiments. Now, lm probably not very frightening to a guy like you. But these crazies, they cant stand it. So when did the nut take over the nut house? They scream and they cry. . . . . .much as youre doing now. Well, hes not faking. Not that one. lll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved. . . . . .to the secure wing at Arkham. l cant treat him here. Storms coming. The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone. lts a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone. Well, he moonlights as a lowlevel enforcer. They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers. Why? What about the other half? Flass knows. He wont talk. Hell talk to me. Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you. He thinks youre dangerous. What do you think? l think youre trying to help. But lve been wrong before. Come on, l aint got all night. Flass, l have kids to feed. What, they dont like falafel? Where were the other drugs going? l never knew. l dont know. l swear to God. Swear to me! l dont l dont know. l never knew. Never. They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers. Why? There was something Something else in the drugs. . . . . .something hidden. What? l never went to the dropoff point. lt was in the Narrows. Cops only go there in force. Do l look like a cop? No! This is the one lm talking about. Whats your problem with it? lt shouldnt exist. This ship left Singapore with lm guessing theres something lm not supposed to find in there. Listen, counselor, we dont wanna know whats in Mr. Falcones crate. Things are working a little differently now. Open it up. What the hell is this? lts you, isnt it? Everybodys been talking about you. Get in here! The other kids wont believe me. Get rid of all traces. Better torch the whole place. All right. Having trouble? Take a seat. Have a drink. You look like a man who takes himself too seriously. Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up. Alfred, help me. Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison. Poisonous. Poisonous. Bruce... ... why do we fall? How long was l out? Two days. lts your birthday. Many happy returns. lve felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent. lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form. You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne. l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day. l analyzed your blood. . . . . .isolating the receptor compounds and the proteinbased catalyst. Am l meant to understand any of that? Not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was. Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. Could you make more? You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne? Well, you know how it is. Youre out at night, looking for kicks. . . . . .someones passing around the weaponized hallucinogens. . . . lll bring what l have. The antidote should inoculate you for now. Alfred, always a pleasure. Lucius. You sure you dont want to come in? l have to get back. l just wanted to leave this. Thank you. Rachel? Looks like someones been burning the candle at both ends. Mustve been quite an occasion. lt is my birthday. l know. lm sorry l cant come tonight. l was just dropping off your present. Youve got better plans? My boss has been missing for 2 days. . . . . .which means l should probably start by looking. . . . . .at the bottom of the river. Rachel. Excuse me. Rachel Dawes. Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Dont take no for an answer. Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning. Whats wrong? lts Falcone. Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch. Youre going to Arkham now? lts in the Narrows, Rachel. You enjoy your party, Bruce. Some of us have work to do. You be careful. Happy birthday. But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving. Keep them happy until l arrive. Tell them that joke you know. Having fun? Bill? Now, whats a big shot like you doing in a place like this? l need some information. The Wayne Enterprise 47B, 1 ME. lts a microwave emitter. lt was designed to vaporize an enemys water supply. Rumor was they tested dispersing waterbased chemicals into the air. . . . . .but isnt that illegal? l want all the information on the development of this project. . . . . .all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away. Did you lose one? lm merging your department with Archives. And l am firing you. Didnt you get the memo? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Miss Dawes, this is most irregular. l have nothing to add to the report l filed with the judge. l have questions about your report. Such as? lsnt it convenient for a 52yearold man who has no history of mental illness. . . . . .to have a psychotic breakdown just when hes about to be indicted? As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms. Scarecrow. Whats scarecrow? Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia. . . . . .on an external tormentor. . . . . .usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes. ln this case, a scarecrow. Hes drugged? Psychopharmacology is my primary field. Im a strong advocate. Outside, he was a giant. ln here, only the mind can grant you power. You enjoy the reversal. l respect the minds power over the body. lts why l do what l do. l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy. l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone. . . . . .including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on. First thing tomorrow, then. Tonight. lve already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General. As you wish. This way, please. Theres something l think you should see. This is where we make the medicine. Perhaps you should have some, clear your head. Who knows youre here? Who knows? Hes here. Who? The Batman. What do we do? What anyone does. . . . . .when a prowler comes around. Call the police. You want the cops here? At this point, they cant stop us. But the Batman has a talent for disruption. Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go. What about her? She hasnt got long. l gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go. The things they say about him. Can he really fly? l heard he can disappear. Well, well find out. Wont we? Taste of your own medicine, doctor? What have you been doing here? Who are you working for? Ras Ras al Ghul. Ras al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for? Crane. Dr. Crane isnt here right now. But if youd like to make an appointment. . . . Batman, put down your weapons and surrender. Youre surrounded. What are you waiting for? Backup. Backup? The Batmans in there. SWATs on the way. But if you wanna go in now. . . . . .lll be right behind you, sir. SWATs on the way. Hey. Hey. Whats happened to her? Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panicinducing toxin. Let me get her down to the medics. They cant help her, but l can. Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley. Cranes been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcones drugs. . . . . .and theyre dumping it into the water supply. What was he planning? l dont know. Was he working for Falcone? He mentioned someone else, someone worse. I need to get her the antidote before the damage becomes permanent. How long does she have? Not long. What is that? Backup. What the? Excuse me. How is she? Shes fading. We gotta go. lll get my car. l brought mine. Yours? lve gotta get me one of those. He is in a vehicle. Make and color? lts a black. . . . . .tank. Stay calm. Youve been poisoned. lm on him. Breathe slowly. Hold on. What are you doing? Shortcut. Air One to ground, block that ramp. Hes got no way off that roof. Turn off your engine. Step away from the car. Trust me. Weapons system activated. Who is this guy? Wheres he going? Hes on the roof. What street is he taking? Hes not on a street. Hes flying on rooftops. At least tell me what it looks like. Never mind. Got him. Coming right up on his butt. Were tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I 1 7. Air One to ground. l lost him. Weve lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked. Well loop back to check the frontage road. Stealth mode activated. Stay with me. What? There he is. Just hold on. Rachel! They get any of this into the mains? Yeah. Notify the water company. Theres gotta be a way to isolate it. No. They put it all in. They mustve been at this for weeks. Gothams entire water supply is laced. Why havent we felt the effects? Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs. How do you feel? Where are we? Why did you bring me here? lf l hadnt, your mind would now be lost. You were poisoned. lt was lt was Dr. Crane. Rest. Gordon has Crane. ls Sergeant Gordon your friend? l dont have the luxury of friends. lm gonna give you a sedative. Youll wake up back at home. When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one. What are they? The antidote. One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production. Mass production? Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready. When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham. . . the only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats. . . . . .was when you said it wasnt about thrillseeking. lts not. What would you call that? Damn good television. lts a miracle no one was killed. l didnt have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred. Youre getting lost inside this monster of yours. lm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did. For Thomas Wayne, helping others. . . . . .wasnt about proving anything to anyone, including himself. lts Rachel, Alfred. She was dying. Shes downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home. Well, we both care for Rachel, but what youre doing has to be beyond that. lt cant be personal, or youre just a vigilante. ls Fox still here? Yes, sir. We need to send these people away. Those are Bruce Waynes guests. You have a name to maintain. l dont care about my name. lts not just your name, sir. lts your fathers name. And its all thats left of him. Dont destroy it. Mr. Earle. Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. How did the stock offering go? Prices soared. Who was buying? All kinds of funds and brokerages. lts a bit technical. The key thing is. . . . . .our companys future is secure. Great. A little the worse for wear, lm afraid. What was the plan, Crane? How were you gonna get your toxin into the air? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Who were you working for, Crane? Oh, its too late. You cant stop it now. Here. Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. Thanks. And thank you for that item. Youre welcome. l know youll put it to good use. l already have. How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale? Weeks. Why? Somebodys planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply. The water supply wont help you disperse an inhalant. What? Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough. . . . . .to vaporize all the water in the mains. A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced. Misplaced? Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it. Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote. The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on. My security clearance has been revoked. That wouldnt stop a man like you, now would it? l suppose not. Bruce, theres somebody here you must meetNot now, Mrs. Delane. Bruce, theres somebody here you must meetNot now, Mrs. Delane. Now, am l pronouncing this right. . . . . .Mr. Ras al Ghul? Youre not Ras al Ghul. l watched him die. But is Ras al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural? Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ras? Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham. . . . . .wouldnt begrudge me dual identities. l saved your life. l warned you about compassion, Bruce. Your quarrel is with me. You let these people go. You are welcome to explain the situation to them. Everyone. Everybody? l. . . . l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze. No, really. Theres a thing about being a Wayne. . . . . .that youre never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves. . . . . .to fill up your mansion with. So heres to you people. Thank you. Thats enough, Bruce. lm not finished. To all of you. . . . All of you phonies, all of you twofaced friends. . . . . .you sycophantic suckups who smile through your teeth at me. . . . . .please, leave me in peace. Please go. Stop smiling, its not a joke. Please leave. The partys over, get out. The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne. Amusing. But pointless. None of these people have long to live. Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand. So Crane was working for you. His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers. He was able to weaponize it. Hes not a member of the League of Shadows? Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom. But really, you are gonna release Cranes poison on the entire city. Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear. Youre gonna destroy millions of lives. Only a cynical man would call what these people have lives, Wayne. Crime. Despair. This is not how man was supposed to live. The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption. . . . . .for thousands of years. We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats. Burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence. . . . . .we return to restore the balance. Gotham isnt beyond saving. Give me more time. There are good people here. Youre defending a city so corrupt. . . . . .we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. Time to play. When l found you in that jail, you were lost. But l believed in you. l took away your fear, and l showed you a path. You were my greatest student. lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world. lll be standing where l belong. Between you and the people of Gotham. No one can save Gotham. When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time. You attacked Gotham before? Of course. Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated. With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics. But we underestimated certain of Gothams citizens. . . . . .such as your parents. Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help. Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal. Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself. . . . . .and Gotham has limped on ever since. We are back to finish the job. And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way. Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary. lf someone stands in the way of true justice. . . . . .you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart. l am gonna stop you. You never did learn. . . . . .to mind your surroundings. Justice is balance. You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even. No one comes out. Make sure. Theyre all gone? How many from maximum security? Every one of them. Serial killers, rapists. Get them to raise the bridges. We dont want any getting off the island. Yeah, lll raise the bridges. . . . . .when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs. . . . . .that are running loose out there. Come on! l hope youre not a member of the fire brigade. Master Wayne! Master Wayne! What is the point of all those pushups if you cant even lift a bloody log? What have l done, Alfred? Everything my family. . . . . .my father, built. . . . The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir. l wanted to save Gotham. l failed. Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up. You still havent given up on me? Never. Harassment! l see harassment! Maybe youd like to see some excessive force? Madman with a gun. With residents furious... ...at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates.... Were about to raise these bridges. Officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass. Just shut up! Hey, Flass, cool it! Hold these people back. Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you. What are you doing here? Our friend sent me with this. lt counteracts Cranes toxin. Hopefully you wont need it. Not unless hes got some way of getting that crap into the air. All right, last one across. People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes! Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman! l cant find my mom. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Gentlemen. . . . . .time to spread the word. And the word is. . . . . .panic. Jesus. The pressure, its spiking. Right there. That water main is right under the Narrows. lts okay. This is Commissioner Loeb. Come on, somebody talk to me. Come on! Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon. What the hell is going on? We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops! Gordon! All the citys riot police are on the island with you! Well, theyre completely incapacitated! lts okay, its okay. No ones gonna hurt you. Of course they are! Crane? No. Scarecrow. Gordon. . . . . .theres nobody left to send in. So lm on my own? The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces. This is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city with toxin . . .theres nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart from mass panic. How are they gonna do that? They ll be using the train. The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower. If they get their machine into Waynes station... itll cause a chain reaction thatll vaporize the entire citys water supply. Covering Gotham in this poison. lm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help. What do you need? Can you drive stick? There you are! There is nothing to fear. . . . . .but fear itself! l am here to help you! Batman will save us. Hell come. Hell come. Dont peek. This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge. l told you hed come. Wait. You could die. At least tell me your name. lts not who l am underneath. . . . . .but what l do that defines me. Bruce? Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally. lt ends here. For you and the police, maybe. My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham. Now, if youll excuse me, l have a city to destroy. l cant beat two of your pawns? As you wish. GPS online. In 100 yards. Gentlemen. Who the hell authorized this? Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles. The pressures moving along the mains, blowing all our pipes. and if that pressure reaches us. . . . . .the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow! At the next intersection, turn right. You will never learn. Sorry. Familiar. Dont you have anything new? How about this?! You have arrived at Wayne Tower. Evacuate the building. Were right on top of the main hub and its gonna blow. Weapons system activated. Nice ride. Armed. Dont be afraid, Bruce. Come on. Come on. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. Thats why you couldnt fight injustice, thats why you cant stop this train. Who said anything about stopping it? Yes! You never learned to mind your surroundings! You finally learned to do what is necessary? l wont kill you. . . . . .but l dont have to save you. The meeting is already started. What meeting? Fox, l seem to remember firing you. You did. l got another job. Yours. On whose authority? Batman may have made the front page. . . . . .but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight. Bruce Wayne. What makes you think you can decide whos running Wayne Enterprises? The fact that lm the owner. What are you talking about? The company went public a week ago. And l bought most of the shares. Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth. Look, its all a bit technical, but the important thing. . . ...is that my companys future is secure. Right, Mr. Fox? Right you are, Mr. Wayne. Didnt you get the memo? lm sorry l didnt tell you, Rachel. No. No, Bruce. . . . . .lm sorry. The day that Chill died, l. . . . l said terrible things. But true things. l was a coward with a gun. . . . . .and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you. l never stopped thinking about you. About us. And when l heard you were back, l. . . . l started to hope. But then l found out about your mask. Batmans just a symbol, Rachel. No. This. . . . . .is your mask. Your real face is the one that criminals now fear. The man l loved. . . . . .the man who vanished. . . . . .he never came back at all. But maybe hes still out there somewhere. Maybe someday,when Gotham no longer needs Batman. . . . . .lll see him again. Proved me wrong, you know. About what? Your father would be very proud of you. Just like me. What will you do? Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick. Just the way it was, sir? Yeah, why? l thought this might be a good opportunity for. . . . . .improving the foundations. ln the southeast corner? Precisely, sir. Nice. l couldnt find any mob bosses. Well, sergeant? lts lieutenant now. You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets. But? The Narrows is lost. And we still havent picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed. We will. We can bring Gotham back. What about escalation? Escalation? We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armorpiercing rounds. And? And youre wearing a mask. . . . . .and jumping off rooftops. Now, take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. Got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. lll look into it. l never said thank you. And youll never have to. This has been a long time coming, fellas. Three years on the plates alone. But youll find the product worth the wait. Go ahead. Take a good look, boys. Jeez, Mr. Sol, I cant tell the difference. Youd need a neutron microscope. Identical, to Ben Franklins stubble. I want half a mil a week laundered in the casino. 34 mil by March. Anybody got a problem with that? The Bat! Get him! Chuckie Sol. Batman! Howd you get here? Your Angel of Death awaits. You aint the Bat! Who are you? What do you want? I want you, Chuckieboy. This time I got you, you lousy, stinking... What...?!  Look!  Good Lord!  What happened?  Hey, look! Its Batman! Im telling you, its vigilantism at its deadliest. How many times are we gonna let Batman cross the line? Councilman, you cant blame Batman for what happened to Chuckie Sol. Why not? Hes a loose cannon, commissioner. Its not just my opinion. A lot of people, including the police... ...think Batmans as unstable as the crooks. What kind of city are we running... ...  when we depend on the support of a potential madman?! Such rot, sir. Why, youre the very model of sanity. By the way, I pressed your tights and put away your exploding gas balls. Thank you, Alfred. Might one inquire what this is? A piece of windshield from Chuckie Sols car. Theres a chemical residue on it. A dense, longchain macromolecular polymer. Adaptogenic, of course. Of course. I should be landing any minute.  Itll be good to see you again.  You too And dont worry about a thing. Well clear up these old family finances. Dont forget... ...youve got a bigtime councilman on your side. I cant believe its been 10 years. Thinking of looking up some old friends? Arthur, dont start that again. Hes ancient history. Thats encouraging. Ill see you soon. Oh, come on, Bruce! All alone in this big mansion... Havent you ever thought about marriage, even once? Never say the M word in front of Bruce. It makes him nervous. What about the l word? The l word? Ingagement. Id watch out for Brucie if I were you, girls. He makes you think youre the only woman hes ever been interested in. And just when youre wondering where to register the china... ...he forgets your phone number. Thats Bruce Waynes style. Bruce? Excuse me. Friend in need? Councilman. So how goes the Bat bashing? Better than your love life. You seem to pick them knowing theres no chance for a serious relationship. Since that one girl. What was her name? Anne? Andi? Andrea? Yes, Andrea Beaumont! There was a sweet number. Howd you let her get loose? Thanks for the handkerchief, Arthur. You know where you can stick it. Andrea... If Daddy gets any more protective, hell build a moat around my bedroom. Times like this I wish you were around to... Excuse me. I thought you were saying something. To me, I mean. Know who that was? Bruce Wayne. You know, Wayne Enterprises? Ive seen him on campus. Very moody. Cute, though.  Yes?  I heard my name. I thought...  Who are you talking to?  My mother. Oh. I didnt mean to... Thats okay. Were done. Mom doesnt have much to say today. Im not the only one who talks to their loved ones. I didnt say anything. When I talk to her out loud, I can imagine how shed reply. I can hear her, like shes right there. I talked to my parents. What did you say?  I made a vow.  What vow? A secret one. A man of mystery! Have you kept your vow? So far. Andrea Beaumont. Bruce Wayne. I know. The boy billionaire. With all that money, why do you always look like you want to jump off a cliff?  Why should you care?  I dont. Mother was asking. Lets step on it! We aint got all night. Wait for me! Coming through. Okay, Skaz. Were done shopping. All clear here. Well, Bruce, here goes. Lets blow this pop stand. On your stomachs, arms spread! Whos this clown? You heard me! Yeah, you heard him, boys. You heard Mr. Kung Fu.  Im shaking.  Say your prayers, sucker! Yes...! Excuse me. Hey, Jonesey! There! I read about your anonymous exploits, and I must say... ...are you sure you wont reconsider rugby? Sorry, Alfred, but the plan is working. I had the edge. I could feel it! There was only one thing wrong. They werent afraid of me. Ive got to strike fear in them. Pardon, Master Bruce. We may want to postpone the shoptalk. I believe you have a visitor. Hi! Hey, what happened to you? Trip over some loose cash? Its been 3 days since we met, and still no calls. I figured you must be dead. You expect every guy you meet to call you? The ones that are smart enough to dial a phone.  What is that?  Jujitsu. Gesundheit. That was a joke. Jujitsu is no joke. It takes years to master. Got a few moves of my own. Miss Hoveys selfdefense class for girls. Oh, he laughs! Nice footwork. Can you dance too? Pardon, sir, but Miss Bambi is dancing on the piano. Brucie! Where are you? You guys wait here. Whatever you say, Mr. Bronski. They say the Bat iced this guy. I know. Chuckie, Chuckie... You always were a loser. Buzz... Whos there? Buzz Bronski. Your Angel of Death awaits. Get away, you freak! Time to pay for your sins, Mr. Bronski. All right, creep. Catch this! What the...? Jake! Dougan! Boys! Come on! He was up here! Boss! Boss! Boys! Hurry! You always were a loser, Mr. Bronski. Farewell, Mr. Bronski! Oh, man! Its the Bat! Its the stinking Bat! Buzz! What do you mean? You have to go after him! He didnt do it! Its garbage, Mr. Reeves. Batman does not kill. Period! You want him, you get him. Ill have no part of it. Well, gentlemen? Any ideas? Hes usually here by now. There appears to be some chemical residue on the lawn. Could match the traces on the glass. Not much, but its been that kind of day. Youd think they could afford a weedeater. Sorry, Mom, but the whole worlds going to seed. You! Bruce? Im having the banker cut through some red tape. He can roll your money into... ...a higheryield account. Amount? What amount? I said account. Im sorry, I was just... reminiscing. Thats okay. You must have a lot on your mind. Monsieur? Remember this place? Sure. You, me and Daddy used to come here all the time. How is the old guy? Youre still close, arent you? Closer than ever. Im sorry he couldnt make it into town, but... ...lve always wished I could have some time alone with you. Well, who knows what the future might bring? Welcome to the Gotham Worlds Fair, a dream of the future A bright tomorrow filled with hope and promise for all mankind This is a vision of the shimmering utopia...  ...  where we shall all spend the rest of our lives Do you think well really see any of this in our lifetime? Bruce, Im talking to you. Oh! Im sorry, Andi.  My mind was on something else.  What? Oh, just, you know... The future! Anyones in particular, or just the generic brand? You know. No, I dont. Since when do you talk to me about your plans? By the way... ...Dads been wanting to meet you.  Oh, yeah? I told him youre not up to it yet. I can meet him. Great! Ill call him right now. You sure about this? Sure, Im sure. What am I doing? This isnt part of the plan. I must be going nuts. If I may make so bold, Master Bruce, Id say quite the reverse. Mr. Beaumont, here are the partnership papers. If you could just go over them... IKnock, knock! This is a most pleasant interruption! At last I meet the elusive Bruce Wayne. Nice to meet you, sir. Sir? Dont be so formal, Bruce. Shes said so much about you, I feel were practically family. Daddy... Dont mind me. I was just leaving. Im sorry. Arthur Reeves, one of the hot Young Turks from my legal department. You should get to know him. I hope were not interrupting. Not at all! Im never too busy for my Andi and her friends. I tell you, Bruce, I do a lot of financial planning. In money matters, you cant take the future for granted. But money means little without loved ones to share it with. Nothings more important than family. Yes, Mr. Beaumont.  Carl.  Excuse me, sir... ...a Mr. Valestra is here to see you. He says he has an appointment... If he says he has an appointment... ...then he has an appointment. Thats what I like about your pop, kiddo. He knows his priorities. Is my shirt too big, or is that my flesh crawling? Mr. Valestra is not what youd call a people person. No kidding! Thats just Daddys business. He deals with everyone. Its not your father, Andi, its... ...its everything! I said hand over the cashbox, man! Give me!  Pops here needs some persuasion.  Dont hurt me!  Stay here! I gotta stop this.  Bruce, dont. What should I do? Just stand here? Just come back to me in one piece, please? Better have your insurance paid up, sucker! Come on! Pick up the box! Pick up the box! Thank God youre all right. I was so frightened! Let me have a look at you. Andrea, please! What am I still doing this for? Its gotta be one or the other. I cant have it both ways. I cant put myself on the line if someones waiting for me at home. Miss Beaumont would be glad to know you feel that way. Shes holding on line one, sir. Master Bruce? Alfred, I cant. Not now. What shall I say, sir? I dont know. I just dont know! It doesnt mean I dont care anymore. I dont want to let you down, honest. But it just doesnt hurt so bad anymore. You can understand, cant you? I can give money to the city to hire more cops. Let others take the risk. Its different now! Please. I need it to be different now. I know I made a promise. But I didnt see this coming! I didnt count on being happy. Please... ...tell me that its okay. Maybe they already have. Maybe they sent me. Get in. All I want to know is, is it true? Is the Batman really hitting our people? We have eyewitnesses. Beautiful. Thats just beautiful. Why? He never leaned on us before. Im too old for this. You could demand police protection. What are you, a comedian? This is the Batman were talking about. A freak job! Hell crucify me! Pull over. Its not very healthy in here. ONeil Funding Corporation. Adams Tool and Die. I shouldve known. Sir? Chuckie Sol and Buzz Bronski. They have a history as partners in dummy corporations... ...set up over 10 years ago. The third director was one Salvatore Valestra. Sals having company tonight. Dont wait up. Meaning, I trust that once youre done with him, youll be seeing her? You think you know everything about me, dont you? I diapered your bottom. I bloody well ought to... sir! Well, youre wrong! Andreas father...? You know how Ive always wanted to see Europe. Dad has business there. Its a hush hush deal. He wont tell me a thing. Not even when wed be coming back. Will you at least let me try to talk you out of it? Wait, please. Never mind. Im no good at this. Here. Youll get the idea. What do you say? Of course I will! I never thought this would happen. I always felt like Id thrown you a curve ball. Like you never knew what to do with me, since I wasnt in the plan. You are now. Im changing the plan. Looks like Dads got company. Businesstype company. He doesnt usually see clients here. Not at this hour. Maybe we should wait to tell him the good news.  Maybe.  Good night, Bruce.  Alfred.  Miss. Its another cave, all right. As big as the house, judging from all the bats that came out of it. Alfred, whats wrong? This just arrived, sir. Left with Dad. Too young... ...need time. Forget about me. My God! If there was just some other way... I hate that song. Gasp! Can it be? Old Sallie The Wheezer Valestra. Welcome, paisan! Its been a dogs age. Hello, Joker. Didnt mean to drop by unannounced. Oh, Salvatore! Why so formal? Mi casa nostra es su casa nostra What does an oldtimer like you want with a twotimer like me? Business. Oh, business! Sounds like fun! Come! Well repair to more comfortable environs. Now hold on to your hat, and watch those valuables. Its going to be a bumpy ride! Honey, Im home! Dont mind my homesecurity system. Down, Rusty. Cant be too careful, with all those weirdos around. What? Meat loaf again? Oh, I had it for lunch! Isnt Hazel here a cutie? True, shes a real homebody, but you cant help who you fall in love with. Come. Have a seat, Sal. Tell me whats on your socalled mind. Its Batman. Hes gone nuts! First he whacked Chuckie Sol... ...then Buzz. Now hes after me. Ive been reading lately how old guanoman is wound tight enough to snap. Wouldnt it be great if Id finally driven him off the deep end? This isnt a joke! Hes knocking us off, and only you can take him down. Five million up front, with whatever you want to finish him off. What do I look like? Pest control? Think, you fool! Once he gets me, how long till he gets you? You know what Im talking about. Your hands are just as dirty. Dirtier! Dont touch me, old man! I dont know where youve been! Oh, Sal, no one could take a joke like you.  Of course Ill help you out.  Really? Certainement No way is anybody gonna hurt my pal Sal. Thats it! Thats what I want to see. A nice, big smile.  Thanks for another lovely dinner.  My pleasure. You know, its not good to go to bed on a full stomach. We could stay up... ...talk for a while. Ive got a killer day tomorrow, Artie. But call me, okay? Good night. So we meet again. I like the cape. Im not sure about the mask though. Have you ever seen this? But thats your father. He set up their corporate partnership. So? Thats his job. Hes the one element that tied these gangsters together.  Wheres your father now?  Havent a clue. Why dont you try Madagascar? Thats not what you told Reeves. You said you were closer than ever to your father. You had me bugged? I can read lips. Then read them now. Get out. Still following your Dads orders? The way I see it, the only one in this room controlled by his parents is you. Sal Valestra... ...your Angel of Death awaits. Guess the joke is on me! Youre not Batman after a Looks like theres a new face in Gotham...  ...  and soon his name will be all over town To say nothing of his legs, feet, spleen...  ...  and head! Stay away! This is not your fight! This madness ends now! Batman, this is the police You are under arrest Step away from the edge of the roof Put your hands on top of your head and stay in the light Stay on him! This is 630 in pursuit Subject moving north along Denny Drive All units approach with caution Subject is armed and dangerous Use of deadly force is authorized Take it down! I gotta get closer! Freeze! Hes heading for the construction site! SWAT deployment teams, move into position All units acknowledge Roger that Moving into position All available units to 4th and Madison, the construction site Charliethree, prepare for tear gas There he is, men! Hey, wait! You jerk! Get a light up there! Deltathree to ground Hes down We have him! Fire! Quick, around the back! Come on, you grunts! Hurry! Whos that? There are certain advantages to having a sturdy cranium. But then, hardheadedness was always your virtue. Well, Im sure I have things to do elsewhere. You have an excellent sense of timing. It was all over TV. I had to do something. Im grateful, of course. But I need to know why you wont tell me the truth about your father. I suppose the worlds greatest detective will find out eventually. You remember Daddy was having a meeting that night with his partners... Youre a liar and a cheat, Carl. Youve taken whats ours.  Youre gonna pay one way or another.  No! Please! Daddy! Whats going on? Im sorry you had to see this, Miss Beaumont. Let her go! Watch it, Carl! Please, Sal, give me one more day. I swear Ill get the money. Convince me. This time tomorrow. On my mothers grave. As soon as the European banks open, Ill have it wired to you. Twentyfour hours. This time tomorrow well have the money... ...or Ill have your heart in my hand. Lets go, boys. Are you all right? Pack a suitcase. Weve got to get to the airport, now! But you said youd have the money. Its not that simple. Its tied up in investments.  It could take weeks.  But I cant leave! Bruce proposed. Were getting married. Listen to me. I just used up the last shred of pity Sal Valestra has. If I dont pay him within 24 hours, theyll kill us both! Why did you do this? Why did you get involved with these people? Im sorry, Andi. I just wanted a chance for you. Ill get you out of this. Well be free of those guys. Whatever it takes. Thats a promise. From that night, we were on the run We hid all over Europe, eventually settled on the Mediterranean coast Dad was able to parlay the money he embezzled into a fortune Finally, he thought he had enough to pay them back. It would never be enough. They wanted interest compounded in blood. He had to find another way. The man in the costume... Your father? He said hed get them. Somehow. When I heard about Chuckie Sol... ...I had to come back... ...to find him, to stop him. Im sorry, Bruce. Thats twice now Ive come into your life and screwed it up. Can we make it work this time? I want to say yes... ...but you know itll come down between me and your father. Daddy doesnt matter anymore. Ill see you tonight. Ill be here. Its so good to see you and Miss Beaumont together again. Might one ask what this bodes for your alter ego? Im not sure, Alfred. Everythings happening so fast. So much has changed. You still love each other. Thats true. I love her. Maybe after this is settled... Maybe then... Im sure theyd have wanted you to be happy. Is something wrong? Maybe. Youre saying there were 4 precincts on Batmans heels, and he still got away? Unbelievable! Tsk, tsk. And to think our tax money goes to pay those jerks. You! Thats right, Artie. Bring in the press, why dont you? What a photoop. The Councilman and his wacky pal! Youre no friend of mine. Oh, Artie, Im crushed! How the high and mighty forget! Dont you remember? You, me... ...Sallie and the gang? What are you talking about? I never met them or you. I worked for Beaumont. I didnt know what he was doing. But you knew about it afterwards. And put it to good use, eh? What do you want? To find out who has iced the old gang. Havent you read the papers? Its Batman! Wrong! It aint the Bat. Nope, Ive seen the guy. He looks more like the Ghost of Christmas Future. Nowhere near as cute as Batboy. You say its someone else? Someone who wouldnt mind seeing our old pals out of the way. Maybe... ...gulp... sob... ...me too! Thats when I thought about you, Arturo. An important, upstanding guy like you could find it awkward... ...if certain secrets were revealed about his past. Wait. Youre not saying that l... Mr Reeves, Miss Beaumont on the line Beaumont? Not the babe! Oh, you devil! Arthur, are you there? Hello, Andrea. Were still on for lunch, right? Im sorry, I cant. I got hung up. Ill explain everything tonight. All right. Ill see you then. Now, aint that a coinkydink? Were talking about the old man... ...and the spawn of his loins just happens to call. Makes you want to laugh, doesnt it? Good heavens! Councilman, please. Youve got to control yourself. Im trying, for Gods sake! Heres the relaxant, doctor. I need some help. IKeep him still! Councilman, please! Thats it. Thats right... That should relax you enough for the toxin to run its course. Try to stay calm. Oh, no! Why did the Joker meet with you? Is it about the gangster murders? He thinks youre involved. Why?! I dont know. Thats not the answer I want. Beaumont needed me to help him and his kid get out of town. He kept in touch. When did you last speak? Years ago. My first election campaign. I was running out of money and asked Beaumont for help. He said no! So you sold him to the Mob. I was broke, desperate! They said all they wanted was their money back. Councilman. Councilman, please! Hello, anybody home? Listen, boopsie, even though you never call and never write... ...I still got a soft spot for you. So Im sending you a fun gift. Airmail. And theres no use jumping out the window this time, toots The plane of the future is going to make you history Hello? Hello, operator? I believe my partys been...  ...  disconnected! You! But he paid you! Dad?! Well, Haze, guess its time to call it a night. What do you say, hon? Feeling the old electricity tonight? Aint it always the way? You get in the mood and company shows up. Joker... ...your Angel of Death awaits. Im impressed, lady. Youre harder to kill than a cockroach on steroids. So, you figured it out? Gotta hand it to you. Nice scheme! Costumes a bit theatrical, but hey, who am I to talk? Very cute... ...but I can blow smoke too, toots! Nice trick, sweetheart. You could teach old Batsy a thing or two about disappearing. Youre not smiling, Joker. I thought you found death amusing. Me? Oh, no. You wont hear a giggle out of me. Made you look! Well, if it isnt Smokey the Babe! Just in time to meet her biggest fan! How about a little pickmeup? Your fathers dead, isnt he? You came into town early to get Chuckie Sol... ...so you could shift the blame to your father. They took everything, Bruce. My dad, my life... ...you. Im not saying its right, or even sane, but its all Ive got left. So either help me or get out of the way! You know I cant do that. Look at what they did to us... ...what we could have had! They had to pay. But Andi, what will vengeance solve? If anyone knows the answer to that, Bruce... ...its you. Leave, Andi. Now. Please. Oh, Batsy! Yoohoo! Youre too late, Batman! There are 20 miles of tunnels under this place. And theyre all filled with explosives. In five minutes, everything goes up! You just dont know when to quit, do you? What are you doing? Youre crazy! Im your only chance to get out of here! Let me go or well both die! Whatever it takes! For once... ...lm stuck without a punch line. Okay... ...I give up. I surrendered already. Tell her, Batman. Youve got to get out of here. The place is wired to explode! No. One way or another, it ends tonight. Goodbye, my love. I couldnt save her, Alfred. I dont think she wanted to be saved. Vengeance blackens the soul, Bruce. I always feared you would become that which you fought against. You walk the edge of that abyss every night, but you havent fallen in. And I thank heaven for that. But Andrea fell into that pit years ago. No one, not even you, could have pulled her back. What is it? Quite a sight. Im sorry... ...do you want to be alone? I am.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas. Penguin sighting! Man or myth? What is he? Todays edition. Another penguin sighting. Another penguin sighting! Check it out! Penguin man living in Gothams sewers! Read all about the latest sighting! May I have your attention, Gotham City? It is time for tonights lighting of the tree. How about that? Part man, part penguin! All horrifying! Find out for only 50 cents! Come on! Read about the possible terror beneath our feet! Check it out! Read about it! Missing link between man and bird. My dear boy... ...sometimes its a diversion to read such rubbish. Usually, its a waste of time. Whatever. Todays issue! The Penguin Man or myth? The Globe! Right here! 25 cents! Well, heres hoping. With luck, Gotham will have its first merry Christmas in years. I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide... ...mentioning the new power plant. But if were to break ground when we must, Ill need permits... ...variances, tax incentives. That sort of pesky nonsense. Power plant? Studies show weve enough power to get us into the middle of the next century. Your analysts foresee growth at 1 per annum. Thats a mild swelling. Imagine... ...a Gotham City... ...of the future, lit up like a blanket of stars... ...but blinking on and off... ...embarrassingly low on juice. Frankly... ...I cringe, Mr. Mayor. Sorry, any plans must go to the usual committees... ...through the usual channels. I have a suggestion. Well... ...actually, really, just more like a question. Im afraid we havent properly housebroken Ms. Kyle. In the plus column, though... ...she makes great coffee. Dad. Mr. Mayor. Time to go down and bring joy to the masses. Actually, more of a question. You stupid corn dog. Corn dog, corn dog. I have enough signatures from Shreck employees to warrant a recall. Thats not a threat, just simple numbers. Maybe. But you sure as hell dont have an issue or a candidate. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. From those of us at City Hall to each and every one of you... ...happy holidays. We have with us a man who needs no introduction, hes given us so much. Please welcome Gothams own Santa Claus, Max Shreck. Pick up those contracts for Personnel and... ...pick up the dry cleaning and paper towels... Darn! I forgot my speech. Remind me to take it out on whatshername. Santa Claus? Afraid not. Im just a poor schmo. Got lucky. Sue me... ...if I want to give some back. I only wish I could hand out more than just... ...expensive baubles. I wish I could hand out world peace... ...and unconditional love... ...wrapped in a big bow. Oh, but you can. Oh, but you will. Merry Christmas. Great idea. Not mine. What are you waiting for? The signal! We want the big guy! The guy who runs the show! What do you want? Not you! Shreck! Youll have to go through me. Dad, go! Save yourself! Dad, go! Shut up! Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and Ill... You missed. The Batman. Or is it just Batman? Your choice, of course. Well, that was... ...very brief. Just like all the men in my life. What men? Well... ...then again, theres you. But you need therapy. Thanks for saving the day, Batman. The Circus Gang is back. Well see. They almost made off with our mover and shaker, Max Shreck. Where is that insufferable son of a bitch? I believe the word youre looking for is... Actually, this is all just a bad dream. Youre at home in bed... ...heavily sedated, resting comfortably... ...dying from the carcinogens youve personally spewed... ...in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony... ...or poetic justice? You tell me. My God, its true. Penguin Man of the sewer. Odd as it may seem, Max... ...you and I have something in common Were both perceived as monsters. But somehow... ...youre a wellrespected monster... ...and I am, to date... ...not! Frankly, I feel thats a bum rap. Im a businessman. Tough, yes. Shrewd, okay. But that does not make me a monster. Dont embarrass yourself, Max! I know all about you. What you hide, I discover. What you put in your toilet... ...I place on my mantle. Get the picture? Is that supposed to hypnotize me? No, just give you a splitting headache. Its not working. Oh, you big baby! Just blanks. Would I go through all this trouble just to kill you? No, Max. I have an entirely other purpose. Im ready, Max. Ive been down here too long. Its time for me to ascend... ...to reemerge... ...with your help... ...your knowhow... ...your savvy. I wasnt born in the sewer, you know. I come from... ...like you. And, like you, I want some respect! A recognition of my basic humanity. But most of all... ...I want to find out who I am... ...by finding my parents... ...learning my human name. Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted! And... ...exactly why am I going to help you? Well... Lets start. Lets see what we have in here. A batch of toxic waste... ...from your clean textile plant! Theres a whole lagoon of this crud in the back! It could have come from anywhere. What about the documents that prove you own half of the firetraps in Gotham City? If there were such documents... ...thats not an admission... ...they wouldve been shredded. Good idea. A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way... ...hows Fred Atkins, your old partner? Fred? Freds actually... I believe hes on an extended vacation. Hes good. Good. Hiya, Max. Remember me? Im Freds hand! Want to greet any other body parts? Remember, Max... ...you flush it, I flaunt it. You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir? I think, perhaps... ...I could help orchestrate a Welcome Home scenario for you. Once were both back home, perhaps we could help each other. You wont regret this, Mr. Shreck. Honey, Im home! Oh, I forgot. Im not married. Miss Kitty. Back from more sexual escapades you refuse to share? Not that Id ever pry. Drink your dinner. What? How can anyone be so pathetic? Yes, to you I seem pathetic, but Im a working girl. Must pay the rent. Maybe if you chipped in instead of stepping out. Selina, dear, its your mother. Just calling to say hello. Yeah, but... But Im disappointed youre not coming home for Christmas. I want to discuss why you insist on languishing in Gotham City... ...as some lowly secretary. Lowly assistant. Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned... Ill be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need to be my own person, not an appendage. Some appendage! The party never stops on Selina Kyles answering machine. I shouldve let him win that last racquetball game. Hello... ...Selina Kyle. Were calling to tell you about exciting, new Gotham Lady perfume. It makes women feel like women... and the men have no complaints either. This is yourself reminding you to come all the way back to the office... ...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...  You stupid corn dog! Working late? Im just boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning. I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant... ...and Mr. Waynes hopedfor investment. I even opened the protected files... How industrious! How did you open the protected files? May I ask? I figured your password was Geraldo, your Chihuahua, and it was. This is all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side... ...about how the power plant is a power plant in name only... ...since, in fact, its going to be a big, giant... ...big, giant... capacitor. And, instead of generating power, itll be sucking power from... ...Gotham City... ...and storing it... ...stockpiling it... ...which is a very novel approach, Id say. Whod you say this to? Nobody. What did curiosity do to the cat? Im no cat. Im just an assistant. A secretary. And a very good one. Too good? Listen... ...its our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless? This power plant... ...is my legacy. Its what I leave behind. For Chip. Nothing must prevent that. Go ahead. Intimidate me. Bully me, if it makes you feel big. Its not like you can kill me! Actually, its a lot like that. For a second, you really frightened me. Really? Honey, Im home! Oh, I forgot. Im not married. Selina, this is your mother. Call me. Selina, this is your mother. Why havent you called me back? Hello, Selina Kyle. Were just calling to make sure youve tried Gotham Lady perfume. One whiff of this and your boss will ask you to stay after work... ...for a candlelight staff meeting for two. Gotham Lady perfume. Exclusively at Shrecks department store. I dont know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel... ...so much yummier. Ladies and gentlemen I stand before you again to denounce the urban chaos we live with in our city. Its got to stop. Its going to stop! Our community is coming apart... ...in a season when it should be coming together. I dont care what the cynics may say. This is the Christmas season... ...and should be a healing time. I say that not only as an official... ...but as a husband and a father. Last nights violence wont happen again. Im not good at speeches, so Ill just say, Thanks.  Its the hideous Penguin Man. Take the baby. Just dont hurt me, please! This was the remarkable scene only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza. The mysterious Penguin saving the life of the mayors baby... ...and announcing his presence.  All I want in return... ...is a chance... ...to find my mom and dad. A chance to find out who they are... ...and thusly... ...who I am. And then... ...with my parents... ...try to understand... why. Why they did what I guess they felt they had to do... ...to a child... ...who was born... ...a little different. A child... ...who spent his first Christmas... ...and many since... ...in a sewer. Mr. Wayne? Something wrong? His parents. This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza. I hope he finds them. Here he is, standing alongside Gothams leading citizen, Max Shreck. How about a statement? People want to know.  Penguins not to be disturbed!  Its a public place!  Walk. Now. Move.  Freedom of the press! Wait a minute. What about the freedom to rediscover your roots... ...with dignity and privacy? Is the Penguin a personal friend? Hes a personal friend of the whole city, so have a heart. Give the Constitution a rest. Its Christmas. Red Triangle Circus put on a swell show with fierce lions. Circus returns for a twoweek... Kids will love... Thanks. Its cold! Its vichyssoise. Its supposed to be cold. Circus is back with a freak show, may not be suitable for kids... ...featuring a poodle lady... ...the worlds fattest man... ...and Aquatic Bird Boy. Why are you determined to prove... ...that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely manbeast in town? The circus folded its tents yesterday... ...after reports of missing children in several towns. Police have closed down the Red Triangle fairgrounds. However, at least one freakshow performer vanished before... ...he could be questioned. I suppose you feel better now. No. Actually, I feel worse. Whyre you still out? Are you concerned about that strange, heroic Penguin person? I think he knows who his parents are. Theres something else. Mr. Penguin... A penguin is a bird that cannot fly! I am a man! I have a name! Oswald Cobblepot! Youll never be able to settle with them? True. I was their NumberOne son... ...and they treated me like number two. But its human nature to fear... ...the unusual. Perhaps... ...when I held my... ...Tiffany baby rattle... ...with a shiny flipper... ...instead of five chubby digits... ...they freaked. But I forgive them. Penguin forgives parents! Im at peace with myself and the world! Dont need hands as long as you got heart. My heart is filled with love. I feel five feet tall.  Hes like a frog that became a prince.  No, hes more like a penguin. Now, now, pretty little thing. Nice and easy. I love a big, strong man whos not afraid to show it with someone half his size. Be gentle, its my first time. Tictactoe. You make it easy, dont you? Always waiting for some Batman to save you. I am Catwoman... ...hear me roar. Id offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time. Good time. Everyone but the banditsll be slacking off till after the New Year. Im not sure I like the inference. I didnt realize I made one. Im pushing this power plant now because itll cost more later. A million saved is a million earned. I commissioned this report. Take a look at it. Gotham City has a power surplus. Im sure you know that. My question is Whats your angle? Power surplus? Bruce, shame on you! No such thing. One can never have too much power. If my life has a meaning, thats the meaning. Ill fight you. Ive already spoken to the mayor and we agree. Mayors come and go. Blue bloods tire easily. Can you go 15 rounds with Muhammad Shreck? I guess well find out. Of course, I dont have a crime boss like Cobblepot in my corner. Crime boss? Shows what you know... ...Mr. ToTheManorBorn WithASilverSpoon. Oswald is Gothams new golden boy. If his parents hadnt 86ed him, youd have been bunkies at prep school. He controls the Red Triangle Gang. I cant prove it yet, but we both... Ill not stand for mudslinging here. If my assistant was here, shed have already escorted you out... Anywhere he wants. Preferably some nightspot grotto... ...or... ...secluded hideaway. Nice suit. Thats my name, dont wear it out or Ill make you buy me a new one. This is Bruce... ...Wayne. Weve met. Have we? No, Im sorry. I mistook me for somebody else. You mean, mistook me. Isnt that what I said? I dont think so. What happened? Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation? Came back? Its a blur. Not complete amnesia. I remember Sister Mary Margaret puking in church... ...and Betsy saying it was morning sickness. And the time I forgot to wear my underpants to school... ...and the name of the boy who noticed was Ricky Friedburg. Hes dead now. But last night... ...complete blur. Couldnt you just die? Please... ...show out Mr. Wayne. With pleasure. Your coat, Mr. Wayne. You dont seem like the type who does business with Shreck. No. You dont seem like the type to take orders from him. Well, thats a... ...long story. I could free up some time.  Im listed.  Im tempted. Im working. Im leaving. You buy that blurry business? Women. Nothing surprises me... ...except your late mother. Whod have thought Selina had a brain to damage? Bottom line? She tries to blackmail me, Ill drop her out of a higher window. Meantime... ...lve got badder fish to fry. Oswald... ...its Max. Youre home? Howve you been? Your extended family? Good to have a family. Id rather not be disturbed now. Come on downstairs, Oswald. I have a surprise. I dont like surprises. Come on. Dont peek. Youll spoil it. Adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know. But someones got to supplant our standing in the way of progress, Mayor. And dont deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, youve got the magic. Your charismas bigger than both of us. Come on down. Mayor? Mayor. Elections happen in November. Its late December. Dont worry. I want you to meet Jen and Josh, my image consultants. Here. Reclaim your birthright. Im Jen. Okay, lets see. What Id like to do first is put these gloves on you. Our research tells us that voters like fingers. So if we were to just lose this... Well do it another time. Not a lot of reflective surfaces in the sewer, huh? Still, it could be worse. My nose could be gushing blood. What do you mean by that? Everybody, back to work! Lets make... ...a mayor! Youre right, we missed the regular election... ...but elected officials can be recalled, impeached... ...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew. Then think of you... ...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void. Id like to fill her void. Well need signatures to overturn the ballot. I can supply those.  Teach her my French flipper trick.  We need one more thing. A platform? Stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world an icebox. I like it. But to get the mayor recalled, we must have a catalyst. Youre doing great, Mayor Cobblepot. Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot. I need you, Oswald. I need you now!  Thats the biggest parasol Ive ever seen. Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Reichstag fire... You want my old friends up there... ...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?  Exactly.  Sounds fun. But... ...I mustnt get sidetracked, Maxie. I have my own things to tend to. Sidetracked? This is your chance to fulfill your destiny... ...that your parents carelessly discarded. Reclaim my birthright, you mean? Imagine, as mayor, you have the ear of the media... ...access to the captains of industry... ...unlimited poontang. You drive a hard bargain, Maxie. All right, Ill be mayor. Burn, baby, burn!  Who is she?  What is she? I dont know whether to open fire or fall in love. You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates. Dont hurt us. Our takehomes less than 300. Youre overpaid. Hit the road. Go ahead and hit me. Admiring your handiwork? Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. UpstandingMayor stuff. Youre not the mayor. Things change. What do you want? The direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. You dont really think youll win, do you? Things change. I saw her first. Got to fly. How could you? Im a woman! Im sorry. As I was saying, Im a woman and cant be taken for granted. Lifes a bitch, now so am I. Who are you? Whos the man behind the bat? Maybe you can help me find... ...the woman... ...behind the cat. No, thats not you. There you are. Saved by Kitty Litter. Bastard! Alfred... ...bring me some antiseptic ointment. Coming. Are you in pain, sir? Not really. I may have saved the mayors baby... ...but I refuse to save a mayor... ...who stood by, helpless as a baby... ...while Gotham was ravaged by a disease... ...that turned Eagle Scouts into crazed clowns... ...and happy homemakers into catwomen. Thank you. Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery manbeast, made his bid to run Gotham. Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest role model a young person could have. And youre the hottest young person... ...a role model could have. Here. Wear a button. Let me just get it on here. Thank you. This mayor stuff is not about power, its about reaching out to people... ...touching people, groping people.  Penguin...  My name is not Penguin! Its Oswald Cobblepot. Oswald, theres somebody here to see you. Just the pussy Ive been looking for. Its chilly in here. Ill warm you. Down, Oswald. We need to talk. You see... ...you and I have something in common. Sounds familiar. Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait, dont tell me. Naked sexual charisma? Batman. The thorn in both our sides. The fly in our ointment. Ointment? Ive got scented and unscented. Ill come back later. Perchance, are you a registered voter? Im a mayoral prospect. I have but one pet cause today Ban the Bat. Oh, him again. No bother. Hes already history. Check it out. Well disassemble his Batmobile and turn it into an Hbomb on wheels. Hed have even more power as a martyr. To destroy Batman, we must first turn him into what he hates the most. Namely, us. Frame him? Not even in office yet and already an enemies list. Those names are not for prying eyes. Why should I trust some catbroad anyway? Maybe youre a screwedup sorority chick getting back at her daddy... ...for not buying her that pony when she turned sweetsixteen. Nice birdie. Nice kitty. Nice kitty. Batman napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I started to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation. A plan is forming. I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all... ...dirty. Maybe Ill just give myself a bath right here. I challenge the mayor... ...to relight the Christmas tree in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night. Sir, shall we change the channel to a program with some dignity and class? The Love Connection perhaps? ...not that I have any faith in the mayor. But I hope and pray... ...that Batman... ...will be present to preserve the peace. Subtle. Why are you doing this? Selina? Sorry, I didnt mean to scare you. Scare me? I was just scaring myself. I dont see how, but... Its nice to see you in the real world, away from Shreck. Its nice to be here. Are you all right? You look like you have the holiday blues or something. Boy, the news these days. Weird! I heard on TV that Catwoman weighs 140 pounds. How do these hacks sleep at night? Its not even accurate. Batman blows it? He probably saved millions in property damage alone. Youre not going to the relighting of the tree, are you? I wouldnt be caught dead there. Its going to be a hot time in the cold town tonight. You got kind of a dark side, dont you? No darker than yours. Why dont you come over and we can watch it on TV? The treelighting ceremony. I cant. I have to be somewhere tonight. How about coming for dinner at five? Lets say six? Five. Five. You and me. The tree lights up and then I push the button. Wait, wait. I push the button, then the tree lights up. Who are you? Talent scout. Come in. I dont just light trees. Im an actress as well. What is that thing? A camera or something? Say, Cheese!  Cheese. Thanks, Alfred. Im sure hes wonderful company... ...but doesnt the goldplatedbachelor bit get a little stale? A lot like the lonelysecretary syndrome, I guess. Executive Assistant. Sorry. Secretary. Any girlfriend? Sure. You mean, as in serious? No. Had one, didnt work. What went wrong? Hang on! I think I know! You kept things from her. I told her everything. The truth frightened her? There are two truths... ...you know? She had trouble reconciling them because I had trouble... ...reconciling them. Vicki thought... Vicki? Ice skater or stewardess? No, she was a photojournalist. Was Vicki right about your... ...difficulty with duality? You see... ...if I say yes, then... ...youll think of me as a... ...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and... You might not let me kiss you. Its the socalled normal guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least theyre committed. I cant do that. Neither can I. This is a special bulletin. The Ice Princess has been kidnapped. Can you confirm reports of Batmans suspected involvement in the abduction? The evidence is purely circumstantial. This was found, stained with blood, in the missing girls dressing room.  I must go.  No, its your house. Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax. Ill be right back. Ive got to go to the plaza.  He is begging me to show.  I hoped youd snub him. I cant. Theres been a kidnapping. Heres what I want you to do. Shit! Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle, I had to go out of town. Tell her that a big business deal came up... You know what? Let her know, not in some kind of dumb, bemygirlfriend way... Ill relay the message. Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that... Bruce, yes... Would you tell him... ...lve been going through... a lot of changes and... Just that... ...this is not a rejection... ...my abruptly leaving. In fact, he makes me feel the way... ...I hope I really am. Could you just make up a sonnet or... a dirty limerick? One has just sprung to mind. This way, maam. Ladies and Gentlemen. Please, may I have your attention? I know that to many of you... ...Gotham seems a bit beleaguered these days. But I want you to know your elected officials... ...and your police department... ...have the situation well in hand. Got to hurry. Thank you. It was set up to look like I did it. Ill tell the police I was kidnapped by an ugly birdman with fish breath. Did somebody say fish? I havent been fed all day. Eat floor. High fiber. Hey, stud... ...I thought we had something together.  We do. Got to go. Girl talk. She let me go. I think cause I reasoned with her, girltogirl. Be careful. Dont move. Lawn dart! Rats with wings, do your thing. Batman pushed the Princess! Hold your fire! Youre catnip to a girl like me. Handsome, dazed... ...and to die for. Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. But a kiss... ...can be even deadlier if you mean it. Youre the second man whos killed me this week. But Ive got seven lives left. I tried to save you... Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead. Or deeply resentful. Maybe you should retire. Damn. Outstanding! Youre Beauty and the Beast... ...in one luscious Christmas gift pack. You said youd scare the Ice Princess. She looked pretty scared to me. A touch of the bubbly? So what are we waiting for? Lets consummate our fiendish union. What? Oh, come on. Cant you picture? Its dark in the mayors mansion. Im bushed, so here you come into the bedroom... ...twitching your little tail... ...my slippers in one hand, a dry martini in the other. Please. I wouldnt touch you to scratch you. You lousy minx! I should have you spayed! You sent out all the signals! I dont think I like you anymore! Goodbye, my unintended. Go to heaven. There he is! Dont adjust your sets. Welcome... ...to the Oswald Cobblepot School of Driving. Gentlemen, start your screaming. This may be a bad time to mention it, but my license has expired! Relax. Ill take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham! You must admit I played this stinking city like a harp from hell! Helpless old lady at 1200 high! Thats funny. Now Im a little worried. So he survived. Why worry? He didnt even lose a limb! An eyeball! Bladder control! Listen to them. Theyve lost faith in old symbols. Theyre ready to bond with you, the icon of the future. If it works, dont fix it. Well celebrate tonight at my annual ball. Shreck and Cobblepot... ...the visionary alliance. When it came time... ...to ensure the safety of our fair city... ...did the mayor have a plan? No! He relied on a man. A Batman. A ticking timebomb of a costumed freak... Our prime concern is this ghastly grotesque. But lets not forget about repairing the Batmobile. Theres security to consider. We cant just take it to any old body shop. Security? Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave? Im working, I turn around and there she is. Hi, Vick. Come on in.  Ready?  Ill take the stairs. You ask... am I up here for personal glory? No. The glory that I yearn to recapture... ...is the glory of Gotham! How can this be accomplished? I know... ...youre all concerned. Relax. Ill take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham. I didnt say that. You must admit I played this stinking city... ...like a harp from hell! You must admit... ...I played this stinking city like a harp from hell! Why is there always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech? There he is! My babies. Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Great speech, Oswald. My name is not Oswald! Its Penguin! I am not a human being! I am an animal. Coldblooded! Crank the A.C.! Where are my lists? Bring me the names! Its time. These are the names of the firstborn sons of Gotham City. Just like I was. And like me, a terrible fate waits for them. Tonight, while their parents party... ...theyll be dreaming away... ...in their safe cribs... ...their soft beds... ...and well snatch them... ...carry them into the sewer... ...and toss them into a deep, dark, watery grave. Penguin? Killing sleeping children... ...isnt that a little... No, its a lot. A reminder. Tonight is that loathsome party hosted by the odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative? Not interested. Although... ...Selina Kyle might be there. Ingenious costume. Let me guess. Trustfund goodygoody? Feeling good? You almost made a monster the mayor of Gotham City. I am the light of this city... ...and I am its mean, twisted soul. Does it matter whos mayor? It does to me. Yawn. Im sorry about yesterday, but I had... ...a pretty big deal come through. Fall through, actually. Its okay. I had to go home and feed my cat. No hard feelings then? Actually... ...semihard, Id say. Theres a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. Why dont we... Take off our costumes? Im tired of wearing masks. Me too. Let me ask you something. Whyd you come tonight?  You first.  To see you. Lovely. I wish I could say the same, but I came for Max. Do you mean you... Not you and Max? Me and Max? No. This and Max. Dont tell me killing Max wont solve anything, because it will. Arent you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron... ...coming out on top when he should be six feet under? You may have problems with your boss, but who do you think you are? I dont know anymore, Bruce. A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. But a kiss can be even deadlier... ...if you mean it. Oh, my God. Does this mean we have to start fighting? Lets go outside.  Are you okay?  Im all right. You didnt invite me... ...so I crashed! What do you want? Right now, my troops... ...are fanning out across town... ...for your children! Yes! For your firstborn sons! The ones you left defenseless at home... ...so you could dress up like jerks... ...get juiced and dance... ...badly! Ive personally come... ...for Gothams favorite son... ...Mr. Chip Shreck. Youre coming with me, you Great White Dope... ...to die, way down in the sewer! Not Chip. If you have any human feeling, take me instead. I dont. So, no! Im the one you want. Isnt it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isnt it Max, not Chip... ...you want to see immersed to his eyeballs in raw sewage? Okay, you got a point. Ill let the little prince live, for now. In the duck! This is going to be good... ...to cut down a whole crop of Gothams most promising... ...before their prime. You ask me... how do I lure them in? A little Pied Penguin action. And you get to watch them sink... ...into a deep puddle... ...of your industrial byproducts. Then... ...you join them. Hurry up and get those kids loaded. Right this way, kiddies. Come with me. So where are all the children? Dear Penguin The children regret theyre unable to attend. Batman!  My dear penguins... ...we stand on a great threshold! Its okay to be scared! Many of you wont be coming back. Thanks to Batman... ...the time has come... ...to punish all Gods children! First, second, third And fourthborn! Why be biased? Male and female! Hell, the sexes are equal... ...with their erogenous zones... ...blown skyhigh! Forward... ...march! The liberation of Gotham... ...has begun! The penguins are moving above ground. Penguin army... ...approaching launch destination at Gotham Plaza. One minute until ignition. They wouldnt put me on a pedestal... ...so Im laying them on a slab! Penguins seem to be converging on Gotham Plaza. Thirty seconds until ignition. Estimated casualties after launch The penguins have reached Gotham Square. Fifteen seconds to ignition. Ready when you are, sir. Ive got the coordinates. Lets turn them around. Something is wrong. Something has jammed the signal. They seem to be turning around. There is also something coming this way. Very large. Very fast. Whos there? Im homing in on the signals origin. Youre jealous because Im a genuine freak... ...and you have to wear a mask! You might be right. But what it all comes down to is Whos holding the umbrella? My babies! I dont know what you want, but I can get it with a minimum of fuss. Money. Jewels. A very big ball of string. Your blood, Max. I gave at the office. A halfpint. Im talking gallons. Lets make a deal! Other than my blood, what can I do? Sorry, Max. A die for a die. Youre not just saving a life... Shut up. Youre going to jail. Dont be naive. The law doesnt apply to people like him... or us. Wrong on both counts. Why do this? Lets just take him to the police. Then we can go home... ...together. Selina... ...dont you see? Were the same. Were the same. Split... ...down the center. Please. Bruce... ...I would love to live with you HROLD Thank you. Hi. Id like to go to the Adelphi Hotel. This is my cab.

Our streets are overrun, our public officials are helpless. As mayor, I promise to root out the source of this corruption... ...Boss Carl Grissom. Now, our new District Attorney, Harvey Dent... ...will carry out that promise. Cheering and applause Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you. People of Gotham City... ...Im a man of few words. But those words will count, and so will my actions. HARVEY Commissioner Gordon informs me... ...that he has targeted those businesses... ...suspected of fronting for the syndicate in this city. Before this week is out... ...we are going to knock down their doors... ...and shed the light of the law on that nest of vipers. Cheering and applause HARVEY Together, we can make this city safe for decent people. Cheering Decent people shouldnt live here. Theyd be happier someplace else. Pretty tough talk about Carl.

Dramatic instrumental theme song ALFRED I thought champagne would be in order, maam. VlCKl Hi, Alfred. Mr. Wayne told me to tell you... ...that he might be a little late. Im not a bit surprised. This yacht is bringing a revolutionary invention to Gotham. On a peaceful motor ride, millionaire Bruce Wayne... ...and his ward, Dick Grayson, have been summoned to Wayne Manor... ...by an urgent but anonymous call for help. The invention and its custodian are reported in grave danger... ...aboard the yacht. Never ones to shirk responsibility... ...Bruce and Dick, with characteristic speed and resolve... ...descend promptly to the Batcave. And then, as they have done many times before... ...as Batman and Robin, courageous warriors against crime... ...they are off, once again, to the rescue. Batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Roger. Ready to move out. Batmobile to airport, red alert. Prepare Batcopter for takeoff. Batmobile approaching. MAN Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all aircraft in the control zone. Enter your holding pattern. Batcopter cleared for takeoff. Its good to know theyre up there doing their job. Batdrift angle 03 to starboard. Roger. Correcting to port. Altitude 31 7. Sink rate 0.49. Drop Bat ladder. Bat ladder away. Lock computer on afterdeck. Set automatic Bathold. Watch out. This could be tricky. Have no fear. Ill keep all my wits about me. So long, for a minute. Batman to Robin, ease off on the power! Increase sink rate! Roger! Wilco! Take her up! Holy sardine! Hand me down the sharkrepellent Bat spray! GORDON Enough pictures. BATMAN This must be brief. OHARA Youre lucky theyll talk. Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times. A yacht approaching the city is said to have disappeared. Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear? lt isnt true? I stand on my answer. Mr. Stanley of The Globe. lt was a Big Ben Distilleries yacht? Thats right. Isnt the proprietor, Commodore Schmidlapp... ...bringing with him a new invention from Big Bens lab? No more questions about that ship. What about that shark? BATMAN Unfortunately, it chanced to swallow a floating mine. I wouldnt worry about that. You there, Miss Comrade Kitanya lrenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff. From The Moscow Bugle. You grace us with your presence. May I be of service? Please, take off the mask to give the better picture. Batman take off his mask? OHARA Shes mad. BATMAN Chief OHara, all of you. This young lady is a stranger. Her request is not unnatural... ...however, impossible to grant. lmpossible? lndeed. If we were to remove our masks, our true identities would be revealed. Ruining their value as crime fighters. Not even we know who they are. In fact, our own relatives dont know. But your so curious costumes.... Dont be put off by them. Under this were ordinary Americans. Youre like the masked vigilantes in the Westerns? Batman and Robin are deputized agents of the law! Support your police is our message. Well said, Robin. And no better way to end this conference. Thank you and good day. MAN Batman OHARA Never mind, everybody out. Come on, were all busy here. A fine job. You allayed their fears. If ld told the truth, panic would grip the city. The truth. And what is the truth? A decoy. An anonymous warning... ...that Schmidlapps in danger, to lure me into a trap. An attempt on his life. While they were luring you to a watery grave... ...the yacht was being hijacked? Precisely! And who behind it? What known super criminals are at large now? Ill check at once, Batman. Lets have the latest status report on criminals at large. Thank you. Coming up on the closedcircuit TV screen. MAN Status report. Known super criminals not currently imprisoned. BATMAN Penguin. That pompous waddling master of foul play... ...maestro of a million criminal umbrellas. ROBlN Joker! OHARA Clown prince of crime! If l had a nickel for every time he baffled us! GORDON The Riddler too? So it seems. To plague us with his conundrums. ROBlN Gosh, and the Catwoman! End of status report. Could be any one of them, but which one? Which ones? Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder. Where theres a fish, theres Penguin. Wait! lt happened at sea. See? C for Catwoman! Yet, that exploding shark was pulling my leg. The Joker! lt all adds up to a sinister riddle. Riddler. Riddler? A thought strikes me. So dreadful l scarcely dare give it utterance. The four of them. Their forces combined. Holy nightmare! Batman, could it be? I dont know. But l think I know where to find a clue. Robin, to the Batcave! We havent one moment to lose! Ahoy, Catwoman. How many times have l told you? Never use my real name in public! You and your trained exploding shark! How should I know theyd have a can... ...of sharkrepellent Bat spray? You sniveling sardine! You pompous puffedup penguin! Friends, make peace. Have a shake on me. A joke a day keeps the gloom away! Sic them, Hecate, scratch out their eyes. Take away that ravenous panther! lll feed him to the birds. Ill incapacitate it with my trick confetti! United Underworld. Were about as united... ...as the members of the United World headquarters. Whats the matter with you all? Shes right. If we dont manage to swallow our supercriminal pride Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right! We must hang together, or we shall hang separately. What a pity that would be on the eve of the greatest criminal coup ever! How did it go, Catwoman? Perfectly. Perfectly. In my disguise as Kitka, I penetrated their press conference. The fools are completely baffled. But undrowned. Yes, unfortunately. Batmans boots didnt even look damp! Our prisoner still doesnt know hes kidnapped? He just keeps ringing for his tea. BELL RINGS There he goes again. PENGUlN Take it to him, man. FOG HORN BLOWS KNOCKlNG Come in. Your tea, commodore. Thank you, steward. Good service aboard this yacht. We strive to give satisfaction, sir. Your face has the most ghastly pallor. Are you getting enough sea air? My duties keep me mostly undercover. Too bad. How much longer will this yacht be fogbound off the Grand Banks? I couldnt say, sir. Well, gives me a chance to catch up on my Dickens. Still, ld like to get to Gotham City. Ive a clever invention with me, stored down in the hold. Should be worth millions of dollars, pippip! Well, pippip to you, sir! If you wish anything further, just ring! FOG HORN BLOWS Schmidlapps invention in our hands... ...the whole world almost literally in our grasp! And Batman and Robin still alive to block us. Everything pippip with the prisoner! Hasnt a clue. l bet the Dynamic Duo has. What? A clue on how we made that ship disappear. And when they solve it Theyll be out to investigate. But well be there first. If we hurry, that is. Catwoman, you tend to this headquarters. Attention, you unfathomable finks! Yoho! Call down to our secret riverbottom dock. Prepare our submarine for sea. Yoho! Yoho what? Sir! Holy Merlin magician! Get set for a shock. The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht. BATMAN My hunch was right. l dont get it Think! As you remarked, no one can make... ...a seagoing vessel simply disappear. Provided it was ever really there at all. You mean? Precisely! The yacht we thought we saw was a mere illusion. A tricky projection akin to the common desert mirage. It deceived our naked eyes... ...but was blocked by the Batcameras Batfilter! I know where that projection came from. Observe that bell buoy. ROBlN What about it? The coordinates of our position were 1 0.3 by 69B. Feed those figures into the navigational aid computer. Roger. No legal bell buoy at that position. As l surmised, an illegal projection buoy cleverly camouflaged. Maybe the crooks left fingerprints! Good thinking, lets find out. To the Batboat, fast! One thing l dont dig, Batman. Oh? If that ship was a mirage, wheres the real one? Taken to some secret island hideaway with every soul aboard, save one. Commodore Schmidlapp? Precisely. For some reason the hijackers needed him... ...or his invention as part of their criminal scheme. Keep an eye on the scope. Watch for suspicious vessels. It looks like weve got the whole ocean to ourselves. Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard, three degrees. Hoist three degrees. I hope you know what youre doing, Penguin. Mr. Riddler, I ignore your insipid insinuation, sir! Mr. Joker, youre leaning on the control! Dont sound so bossy, if you please! As the poet says On land, you may command. At sea, it is me! Now hear this. This is your captain speaking, my fine pinioned pirates. Were approaching the buoy. There may be skullduggery ahead! MAN Yoho! What? What? Unidentified small craft, bearing 1 1 3. Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady! Up periscope! Great quivering icebergs! Just as I hoped. BATMAN Watch your step, Robin. An underwater shark cage. The source of that fish. What cruelty! Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT! Nothings sacred to those devils. Torpedoes! What are we waiting for? Chain of command, Mr. Riddler. The Penguin runs the ship. Mr. Joker. Load the torpedo tubes! Yoho! Load torpedo tubes! Salt and corrosion. The infamous old enemies of the crime fighter. No prints here. Look here, Batman. That tricky mirage projector must be behind this plate. Wow! What a set of superpower lenses! No wonder we were fooled. Look, Robin. ROBlN Holy Long John Silver! A periscope! He spotted us! Set torpedoes to automatic homing. Set torpedoes to automatic homing! You crazy bird. Fire them off, quickly! Activate the remote control Penguin magnet inside that buoy. Yoho! Holy glue pot! Whats going on? The fiends! Theyve converted this buoy into a gigantic magnet! Its got us by the metallic objects in our utility belts. Torpedo tubes armed! Batman! Were helpless in this monstrous, invisible grip! Steady, Robin. l see one hope. What, Batman? If l could just pry loose my utility belt transmitter! Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire? Yoho, ready to fire! Five, four, three, two. Fire 1 ! Fire 1 ! Torpedoes! If l can just reverse the polarity, send out waves of super energy. What happened? Mr. Joker, fire 2! Fire 2! Here comes another one! You and your reconditioned surplus torpedoes! He must be using a super energy reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3! Fire 3! Here comes a third one! Confound it, the batteries are dead! This ones getting through! It is. lts getting through. TORPEDO EXPLODES Surface, Mr. Bluebeard! Let us feast our eyes on the watery remains! Gosh, the nobility of the almosthuman porpoise. True, Robin. It was noble of that animal... ...to hurl himself into the path of that torpedo. He gave his life for ours. Operator, give me the Pentagon, Navy department. Too bad. PHONE RlNGS Admiral Fangschliesters office. Hello, Batman speaking. Oh, hello. Who is it? Batman. Oh, Batman. Hello, Batman. Ahoy! What can I do for you? Hello, admiral. A routine question. Have you recently sold surplus submarines? lf so, to whom? Just a moment, Ill have to look that up. WHlSTLES Keep practicing. Answer affirmative. We disposed of a surplus submarine on Friday. A preatomic model. To some chap named P.N. Gwynne. P.N. Gwynne? The Penguin! Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address? Just a post office box number. Would you like it? No, thank you, admiral. Youve been very helpful. Your tone sounds grim. We havent done anything foolish? Disposing of submarines to persons who dont even leave their addresses? Good day, admiral. Gosh! The Penguin in command of a preatomic submarine! Grave situation, Robin. lf only we knew what he was up to! RUMBLING Holy Polaris! From that submarine, no doubt. That missile, its written something. ROBlN A riddle, in the form of a joke! Lets race back to headquarters. You know what this means, dont you? Our fear is confirmed. Penguin, Joker, Riddler, their forces combined. Heaven only knows the objective! lt may be worse. Worse? Saints alive, how can that be? Look at this pair of riddles. What does a turkey do when he flies upside down? He gobbles up. Of course. And number two. What weighs 6 ounces, sits in a tree and is dangerous? A sparrow with a machine gun. Of course. Now, combine both answers. What kind of creature would gobble up a bird in a tree? Heaven protect us, a cat! Yes, the criminal catalyst in this entire affair... ...our old archenemy, Catwoman. Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman too! The sum of the angles of that rectangle is monstrous. Weve been given warning. They work to take over Gotham City? Any two of them might try that! The whole country? lf it were three, ld say yes. But four? Their minimum objective must be... ...the entire world. CATWOMAN The United World building, comrades. Our objective, the Security Council. Sitting like fat birds in a tree just waiting to be snatched. And you bungled it! The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap! Passing porpoises which intercept torpedoes! There ought to be a piscatorial statute! Time is short! Weve got to get Batman before he gets us. I could lure him into a giant exploding octopus After one of your fishy explosions, theyre still in one piece. I suppose theyll be broken up by your moldy jokes! Shut up, all of you! I see the way to do it. Well play each of our treacherous trumps in one hand. And well do it right here! How? How? The end. The end of.... We shall spring them from the Jokers jackinthebox... ...through that window, out over the sea... ...and into the waiting arms of the Penguins exploding octopus! The trigger? One of my riddles. And the bait? You, Catwoman. Youre mad. The minute Batman spots her... ...hell bop her with a Batarang. You dont understand. She will be disguised as Kitka. And as Kitka, she shall lure some millionaire into a kidnap trap. Of course! With a clever clue pointing here. Batman will race to the rescue. Capital! But who are we going to kidnap? I know the perfect victim. I know the perfect victim! l know! Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head... ...of that disgusting dogooding Wayne Foundation. Delicious! Just the sort of square citizen Batman will dash to rescue. Then snap! lnto the combination trap. Perfect, Riddler, perfect. Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff. Im from The Moscow Bugle. My friends call me Kitka. Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym. Thank you, Comrade Wayne. The Wayne Foundation is known from Leningrad to Kamchatka. It works for peace and understanding. Your picture has appeared countless times in The Moscow Bugle. Im most grateful, I wasnt aware of that. Oh, da, da. You found these riddles on Wayne Foundation stationery under your door? Yes, Comrade Wayne. Thats why I brought them to you. I thought it was some foolishness, then l remembered Is there not a bourgeois criminal cad... ...the Riddler, who preys upon the workers? Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka. But there is such a creature. What do we do now? Report these riddles to your police... ...or perhaps to that Cossack Batman? Thats hardly necessary at the moment. Doubtless its the work of some harmless crank. Nevertheless, shall we give this matter further consideration... ...over dinner tonight? What a perfectly lovely idea. Ill telephone to cancel a previous engagement. Alfred will see you to the door. Do vechera. Do vechera, Comrade Wayne. Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please. Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency. Very good, sir. Listen to these riddles. Tell me if you interpret them as l do. What has yellow skin and writes? A ballpoint banana. Right. What people are always in a hurry? Rushing people? Russians! Right again. What would you say they mean? Banana, Russian.... A Russian will slip on a banana peel and break their neck! Precisely, the only possible meaning. A clear threat to Miss Kitkas life. Who? Miss Kitka, the charming Russian journalist for The Moscow Bugle. In some way she must have unwittingly stumbled on the criminals plot! What is the scheme? Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out on the town with Miss Kitka. A not displeasing chore. lndeed. Ive rarely met a girl... ...whos a potent argument in favor of international relations. You will dog our footsteps in the Batmobile. Youll keep watch via the Batscanner. lf the Riddler tries to make good lll bash him brutally. Then we close in with the police. Yes. Got your drivers license? ln my wallet. Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck! This may be a memorable night. SINGS IN FRENCH This curtain which separates our countries is so foolish. If we could just contrive... ...some way of getting more deeply involved with each other. Da, we must search for such a method. WHlSPERS Its wrong to listen to this. Some things have to be private, even for a crime fighter. Your discretion is admirable, Master Robin, yes. Time for another checkin. Roger. BEEPlNG Commissioner. Yes? Yes, Boy Wonder. Batmobile position Gotham Park, proceeding south on West Drive. About to pass Benedict Arnold monument. Still in the park? lts been almost an hour. What are they doing? No comment, commissioner. Lets just say, no sign of criminal activity. Yes, l understand. Ive just thought of a clever ruse. Have Chief OHara flash the Batsignal. If you say so, but why? The crooks will think were racing to headquarters. Thinking were out of the way, they might strike at Miss Kitka! Devilishly clever! Thank you. Batmobile over and out. Right. Chief OHara, flash the Batsignal. Yes, sir. Shades of Smolensk, what is that? BRUCE Incredible, I dont Of course! How clever. Clever, Comrade Wayne? I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka. Its the Batsignal, from the roof of police headquarters. Batman must be racing there in response. Then you did get the police to call them in for my protection. Yes, yes. How perfectly wonderful of you! I close my eyes and l dream of those savage Cossacks... ...racing over the steps on their mission. How strange. I close my eyes, and l dream of something... ...quite astonishingly different. Da, da. Keep your eyes closed. Continue with this dream. The dream continues. BEEPlNG IN MORSE CODE lt approaches a climax. Nyet. Not so fast. Be more slow. Miss Kitka? May I see you home to that penthouse apartment? He swallowed the Catbait! And now to make him Batbait. Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch, the jetpack umbrellas! Yohoho, sir! Ill slip into something more comfortable... ...while your cocoa is warming. Is that prudent? Our instructions were to keep watch. I dont know about prudent. But its the only decent thing to do. Perhaps. Yes, yes. There it is, 73rd Street and Concord Avenue. Follow me down to the terrace. And all my days are trances And all my nightly dreams Are where thy dark eye glances And where thy footstep gleams SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka. To One in Paradise, first stanza. About that dream you had.... Do we dare? Why not? Yes, of course. Why not? Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action? Into action, comrade. Miss Kitka, I have the strangest feeling... ...that l am about to be utterly and madly carried away. CRASHlNG This is a kidnapping! Our jokes on you! You filthy criminals! HlSSES Much as one deplores indiscretion Right. Ill just take one tiny, tiny peek. Holy demolition! Bless my dustpan! Cover the exits. Ill race up with my Batrope! Holy Halloween! HOWLS Strange, Batman shouldve been here hours ago. Maybe you didnt leave a clear enough clue. I did! l cant understand why Batman hasnt dashed into our trap. He puts his foot here, my secret jackinthebox fires... ...shooting him over the sea... ...into the waiting arms of Penguins exploding octopus. What a deliciously humorous trajectory! And nothing to link us with the crime. You abominable outlaws! What have you done with Miss Kitka? Shes quite well, Mr. Wayne. I swear by heaven, if youve harmed that girl... ...lll kill you all. Ill rend you limb from limb! Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive? Where is she? Show me Miss Kitka... ...or lll wreck this place with my dying breath! Blindfold the captive. Lead him down the labyrinthine path to chamber 1 7. Two minutes, no more. Turn on the secret microphone. Quiet, quiet! Miss Kitka. Comrade Wayne. Are you all right? Da, da. Ill curse myself forever. This nasty soup were in is of my brewing. If l hadnt let your beauty lull me off guard.... Off guard, comrade? There are some things I cannot disclose. But were in the hands of the most vicious foursome. I fear we have nothing to look forward to but death. It may not be that black, Comrade Wayne. Batman and Robin are probably hot on our trail. From something I happened to overhear... ...l think we are merely bait for Batman. Once hes in their trap, well be released. A slender hope, Miss Kitka. More slender than you can know. You do not think Batman will get here? That I cannot say. Did you overhear any mention... ...of any other prisoner of this rotten gang? No, I did not. Who on earth could you mean? BELL RINGS Commodore Schmidlapp ringing for his tea. Just a thought, it doesnt matter. Speedy escape is our only hope. A moment, while l think.... Why didnt l think of it sooner? BELL RINGS Of what? Up my sleeve I have a radio transmitter strapped above my elbow. What a curious device to carry. Not at all. Capitalists who carry a lot of money have safety contrivances. If l can just get at it.... Wiggle around backtoback. Maybe you can reach it with your fingers. Da. Lets get him. There we are. You think youre pretty clever, dont you? Clever enough to outwit you. Well see about that. Dear colleagues, lets see whats strapped above his left elbow. Cretinous creatures! I knew youd been listening in! I told you that fish story about a radio.... Get him! Miss Kitka! Where are you? Great day! Hello, commissioner. Dick, were late for that demonstration. Excuse us. But you cant dash off now. How did you escape? With the aid of Batman. Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader. Return to police headquarters. He may wish to call you. My fine finkish friends, you have heard my astounding proposal. What do you say? What do you say?! Our strike cannot be postponed. Were at the mercy of the Gotham River tide. Its now or never to get through the channel. Batman will never come here now. But the police will, any instant. So, to the Penguins princely plan. Is it yes or no? Its crazy, but lets try it. We have to get Batman out of the way. Oh, go ahead, Penguin. Would you drop one of your dream pills into Commodore Schmidlapps tea? Presto! Then carry him to the submarine! Mr. Riddler, will you tell Mr. Quetch... ...to fetch the five guinea pigs? Fetch the guinea pigs. Yoho. Yohoho, sir! Now, my fine fishy finks... ...you see the commodores pice de norsistance... ...an instant whiskey maker. Waiting for us to put it to more universal use. Dont be afraid. Youll feel nothing. I am merely going to temporarily extract... ...every bit of moisture from your bodies! Its a painless operation. Delightful! Dehydrated! Catwoman, will you get a dustpan... ...and put every one of them very carefully into separate vials? Mr. Riddler, would you prepare the submarine to get underway... ...while l prepare a terrifying demolition charge for the police? Where do we meet? United World building. Gotham River. 39th floor. The elevator. One hour? One hour. What criminal genius, Catwoman! Who but a genius could conceive such an audacious plot? To trick Batman and Robin into inviting me to their Batcave... ...with five dehydrated deathdealing pirates at my command. Careful, careful. Every one of them has a mother. Out, Batarang and Batrope. Stand clear. With people in weird outfits like the supercrooks around here... ...its amazing no one reports this place to the police! Its a low neighborhood, full of rum pots. They attribute curious sights to alcoholic delusions. Gosh, drink is sure a filthy thing. Id rather be dead than unable to trust my own eyes. Yes, honey. There was someone walking up the wall. Ready with superblinding Batpellets. Away, Robin. Away! But Come on, Batman. Batman! Miss Kitka! BAND PLAYS Quick, everyone! Flee for your lives! lnto the street! Some days you just cant get rid of a bomb. BOMB EXPLODES Batman. Batman! lts all right. Holy heart failure! I was able to dispose of that bomb just in time... ...and shield myself behind these heavy iron pipes. You risked your life to save that riffraff in the bar? They may be drinkers, but theyre also human beings... ...and may be salvaged. I had to do it! But we lost the trail of that angelic Miss Kitka. Stranded without a clue! Ahoy there! Could you chaps direct me to a policeman? Commodore Schmidlapps the name. Big Ben Distilleries, you know. Holy costume party. The Penguin! Obviously. Whats his game? Whats your game, Penguin? Penguin? No, my names Schmidlapp, old boy, Schmidlapp. Your fingerprints will settle that hash. Well check them against our mobile anticrime file in our Batmobile. Lets see your hands. Looks like plasticcoated fingertips! Yes, l scorched myself pressing a waistcoat. I do believe the attending surgeon did use plastic, yes. It looks bad. This brassy bird has us buffaloed. Not quite. Theres one method of identification no one can evade. Retinal eye patterns? Hes right. The pattern of blood vessels... ...in the retina, as individual as a fingerprint. Dont you have an anticriminal, eyepattern master file... ...in your Batcave? Why dont you take me there? Youll submit yourself to a test? lt might be an amusing experience. Stand by to catch him, Robin. Ill give him the Batgas. What? Batgas? An anesthetic, necessary to prevent you from seeing... ...the entrance to the Batcave. If anyone knew that, they could pierce the secret of our identities. Ready, commodore? Oh, l say, what deucedly strange customs you colonials have! Well, lm ready. To the Batmobile. This could be our break. Why did he let us take him? Well soon know. lve got the eye checker. Stay on alert. After l give him the Batwake, we must be ready for anything. Oh, its you. Were here, eh? l see. Oh, whats this? Oh, say! This is extraordinary! Its absolutely extraordinary! I must say, your laboratory exceeds the limits... ...of mans wildest imagination. Could l trouble you for a glass of water? Your Batgas has left me with a parched sensation. The water dispenser is clearly marked. All right, thank you. Thank you, sir. Help yourself, commodore. Slake your thirst. Youll have worse than a parched sensation when were through. Perhaps, perhaps. But l am appalled by your attitude, sir. Condemning me before the facts have been authoritatively established! You are abrogating my constitutional rights, sir. ROBlN All set. Come on, Penguin. Time to rip off your false feathers. Coming, Batman. Im coming at once. ROBlN Holy hallucination! I wish it were, but its five dehydrated pirates, rehydrated! At them, me hearties! Shiver them from stem to stern! Yohoho, sir! Attack them, you faltering fink! Theyre gone! Popped like balloons. How did it happen? Whoever dehydrated those pirates... ...couldnt have foreseen their rehydration with the heavy water... ...we use to recharge the atomic pile! It left them in an unstable condition! You saw it yourself. The slightest impact was sufficient... ...to instantly reduce them to antimatter. Antimatter? You mean, they wont be coming back? No, Robin. Not in this universe. Let that be a lesson in the dangers... ...of tampering with the laws of Mother Nature. My apologies, commodore. Ive done you a cruel injustice. You have? You were duped. Brainwashed. The criminals planted those dehydrated thugs on you. You were obviously under the influence... ...of posthypnotic suggestion when you rehydrated them. Come on down, commodore. Another sniff of Batgas, and well all return to the city. Are you sure you didnt hurt your head? Perfectly. Swallow this pill. Now, give our friend here a whiff of Batwake. Good morning. Whats wrong? Manifold pressures dropping. Wed better stop and check it. Sorry about that. Wont take long. Yes, you will! Yoho and away we go in my Birdmobile! One side kick for a sailor. You okay? Thanks to the antiPenguin gas pill! Hes played right into our hands. Via Batcycle to the Batcopter! Well track him to the gangs new hideout. Disengage gocart. Batscanner tracking the stolen Batmobile. Port two degrees, then steady as she goes! Yoho, port two degrees! Were almost there! Where are you going? To fire off more riddling clues. Riddler! Youre mad! Penguins finished Batman by now. That miserable, waddling mountebank of a bird! He couldnt finish a bag of popcorn! Say Penguin failed. All the more reason not to hand them clues. But l must! Outwitting Batman is my sole delight... ...my joy, my heaven on earth, my very paradise. Riddler, come back! Stolen Batmobile turning, heading up Gotham River Drive. Polaristype missile coming right for us! Hold on! This may be tricky. Damage? The tail rotors disengaged. Brace yourself, Robin, were going down. This could be the end. Now, to find my riddling Polaris skywriter! Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo! I got them. I got them. Holy horseshoe! Some luck, landing right on top of a bed of foam rubber! The odds against it would make even the most reckless gambler cringe. True, I did think ld spotted it out of the corner of my eye, but That crazy missile wrote two more riddles before it blew up. An egg! Make applesauce. Apples into applesauce. A unification into one smooth mixture. An egg, natures perfect container. The container of our future hopes. A unification in a container of hope? United World Organization! Precisely! And the Security Council meets today. lf what l fear is true Lets commandeer a taxi. No, not at this time of day. Luckily were in tiptop condition.

MEOWS As the blueprint said, an abandoned construction elevator. Hecate, sniff out the weak spot. MEOWS l hope Penguin made it. Who needs him? Stand back. Hey! Cant you read? A fine day for penguins. My coconspirators, we meet as planned. No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo has been silenced forever. Blasted out of the sky by a coincidence! The delicious irony of it! Downed by Riddlers Polaris skywriter. Happy happenstance! Hold your breaths as we cross the hall. There are still lingering traces of my finely filtered Penguin gas. Holy marathon! lm getting a stitch! Lets hope its a stitch in time that saves nine. The nine members of the Security Council. SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES It is the opinion of Her Majesty that we pursue peace at all costs. Our poor united world in microcosm. Im afraid theyll find our humor very, very dry. We understand your position, but for peace It has always been our policy Quickly now! Each one in a separate vial. And, boys, dont anybody sneeze. BATMAN Seal the building! ROBlN Close the ventilating system! The Security Council may have been dehydrated! Emergency, operator. Get me security. Emergency, operator, emergency! Up, up, up, up! Surrender! You criminals! The United Underworld is through! Whats this, an apparition? One false move, and youll find out. Well hurl our Batarangs! To the elevator! Catwoman! Stop, l said! I dont think you mean that. Miss Kitka dies if you take one more step! Go! This way, Robin! The Security Council, gone! What a fiendishly clever way to abduct nine men... ...from a heavily guarded building! Where does that elevator go? Downstairs, to an abandoned submarine dock on the river. Holy Captain Nemo! Theyll head for sea by way of Short lsland Sound. We have just one trump card left. Heaven help the world if we fail. Come on! Down periscope. Were over the last bar. Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead. Yoho, all engines full ahead! What a delightful haul!

Its filled with human jetsam. Come, take it in tow. Robin. Over here, look. The hope of the world, tottering on the brink! Holy almost! To think, it might have been shattered before our very eyes.

Increase angstrom force in vector X. Vector X up one notch. BEEPlNG Yes, commissioner? What progress? ls there hope? Theres always hope. But do you think you and Robin can separate that mingled dust... ...back into its constituent members? With all modesty, commissioner... ...if we cant, heaven knows who can. Truer words were never spoken. PRESIDENT Howdy, you all. How are those boys doing up there? Batman says theres hope, Mr. President. What more can one ask? The free world is waiting. Tell Batman I salute him and wish him luck. I neednt tell you with whom l have just spoken. Ready for separation. All right. Ill activate the computer link. Input the ethnic and national factors. Batman, wait a minute! What? Well, with the way the world is and all... ...maybe we ought to try to improve those factors? Reshuffle them a little. No. Its not for us to tamper with the laws of nature. In this very Batcave, you saw a ghastly example... ...of what happens when one tries to do that. Gosh, yes. When you put it that way.... Here we go. BEEPlNG Yes? Separation accomplished. Ready to rehydrate. Separation accomplished. They are ready to rehydrate. We are ready to rehydrate.

This strange mixing of minds... ...may be the greatest single service ever performed for humanity. Lets go, but inconspicuously. Through the window. Well use our Batropes. Our job is finished. Alert the queen. Hyah! Bruce Vayne. Bruce Wayne. Talk. I believe there is a stranger. Comes to this village from the sea. He comes in the winter when the people are hungry. He brings fish. He comes on the king tide. That was last night. You have eyes, so see. Icebergs in the harbor. Its four months since the last ship got through. Well, this stranger doesnt come by ship. There are enemies coming from far away. I need warriors. This stranger, others like him. Im building an alliance to defend ourselves. Its very important that I see this man. If this stranger exists, hell give him your message. 5,000 American. Look, Ill give you 25,000 to talk to this man right now, outside. How dare this dog speak to us like children. Ooh, magical man from the sea. We are poor, not stupid. Get out. Im sorry. Cant do that. Ill leave after weve spoken. He said, Get out. Arthur Curry. Also known as Protector of the Oceans. The Aquaman. So, let me get this straight. You do it dressed like a bat? Like an actual bat? Worked for 20 years in Gotham. Oh, that shithole. When the fight comes, well need you.  Dont count on it, Batman.  Why not? Cause I dont like you coming here, digging into my business and getting into my life. I want to be left alone. Is that why you do this? Why you help these people out here in the middle of nowhere? Ive read the stories. Your good deeds you think no one sees. Youll join us. Strong man is strongest alone. You ever heard that? You ever hear of Superman? He died fighting next to me. My point exactly. He believed we were stronger together. We owe it to him. I dont owe anyone anything. Dressed like a bat. Youre out of your mind, Bruce Wayne. Move over, Dusty. My God, Master Wayne, but this is cold. Maybe we can catch the next king tide in Jamaica? Might be a metahuman or two in Fiji. Costa Ricas nice. I found him. He said no. So the draft stands at naught for two? Maybe a man who broods in a cave for a living isnt cut out to be a recruiter. Hmm? Thats 10, please. Good morning, Miss Lane. Jerry, hi. Wow. You dont miss a day, do you? Like it here. Excuse me. Move! Move it! Move it!  No, mate, dont shoot!  Move, move! Get the fuck over there! Move! All of ya! Line them up along the wall. Keep them quiet.  Keep quiet!  Shut up! Shut up! Shut them up too! Well be making a statement shortly. Until then, if I see any movement, youll have a lot of dead kids on your hands. Should I take him? Hold your fire. Theyve got kids in there. Yeah, hes not bluffing, chief. St. Brigids had a school trip today. Quiet! Shut up! Down with the modern world. Back to the Dark Ages. Quiet! I said shut your fucking mouth. Who are you? The Lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth. Now, who are you? Were a small group of reactionary terrorists who wanna turn back the clock in Europe  a thousand years.  Boring. Why the hostages? We have no demands. Were just stalling the police while we do it. While you do what? Youre too late. The countdowns already begun. In a few minutes, four city blocks... ...while the world watches. No! Like lambs to the slaughter. I dont believe it. Believe it. Is everyone all right? Are you okay? Good. Its okay. Its okay. Its over. You can stand up. Its all good. Its over now. Are you okay? You okay? Good. Are you okay, princess? Can I be like you someday? You can be anything you want to be. Come on. Lets go. Any changes today? No, my Queen. The Mother Box has awoken, yet nothing has happened. It has slept for thousands of years since the First Age. Why did it wake at all? This is the first time its gone quiet since the crack appeared. Maybe its going back to sleep. Evil does not sleep. It waits. Something is coming. Prepare for battle! Amazons, on your marks! Ready! Defenders. They have failed 100,000 worlds. They always fail. Ive come to enlighten you to the great darkness. I will bathe in your fear. Daughters of Themyscira, show him your fear! We have no fear! Gather the legions! Go with her! You must seal the cage!  Go!  Phillipus! No! Behind you! Ahhh! Epione. Honor us. Its right. Seal it. Ready the hammers! Seal it now! Guard it with your life.  Yes, my Queen.  Keep it moving. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Got it! Go! Hyah! Oh, noble Queen. Why do you fight? You cant save her. You cant save any of them. The great darkness begins. Amazons! Yes, we will find the others. Draw! Loose! Hes gone back to his universe. No. Hes gone to the lands of men to find the other two boxes. We have to light the ancient warning fire. The fire has not burned for 5,000 years. Men wont know what it means. Men wont. She will. Its toxic. Thats good. Go! Follow the scent of the Mother Boxes. Find the missing two. Once they are found, The Unity will be formed. This world will join the others. He will be pleased. He will see my worth again. Hey. Anything on that kid from the liquor store? Possibly. Possibly. If I had a dollar for every possibly. Yeah, it would make you even more insufferable. Facial scan might have got a hit on him, our disappearing man. One Mr. Barry Allen from Central City. Might be another false positive, youll have to give me a little time  to confirm.  We dont have any more time. Master Wayne, youve been working as if theres no tomorrow to build this team of people you cant even find. I found one. I found two, including Diana. Just because Lex Luthor says the planets in danger of attack? This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor. It has to do with him. I made a promise to him on his grave. I spent a lot of time trying to divide us. I need to bring us together and make this right. Well, its been some time since Luthors warning. No attacks. No barbarians at the gate. Maybe these barbarians dont use a gate. Maybe theyre already here. Keep looking. What else do you have? Labs all yours, Howard. 1130. Early night for you, Silas. Yes, early night. Tell your family I said hello. What the... Jesus. The Arrow of Artemis. It will reach the lands of men. Sky torch, hero beacon, scatter the darkness. Burn as you burned in days before. Show her the darkness before the daylight of history. Warn my daughter that war has come and protect her. Return to me, Diana. What did you do this weekend, Diana? Nothing very interesting. Thats all you ever tell us. What can I do? Im not that exciting. You might as well disappear when you walk out of here. Again?  What is it?  Now what? Budget cuts, tomb raiders. Now add to the list arson. Yes, good morning from the isle of Crete. As you can see behind me, an enormous bonfire is burning. This fire has been burning through the night. Were now into the morning and we are at least five miles away. And we can still see it burning as we speak. This has baffled locals and government authorities alike here at this historical site of the socalled shrine of the Amazons. Now, locals and government officials are baffled as to  what may have caused this.  Invasion. Ryan.  Hiya, Doc.  Is the... No damage to the electronlaser.  Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?  Yeah.  Ryan Choi?  Thats us. Um, who did this? Did they steal anything? They took whatever was in here. That? Oh, that wasnt stolen. Was it, Dr. Stone? No. That was misplaced a while ago. Object 61982. Department of Defense Archives.  Mmmhmm.  What was it? I dont know. You dont know? I dont know, which was why I was studying it. Whats your rank, Doctor? Ryan, would you, uh, do the honors?  Sure. Okay.  Thanks. Civilian. STARLABS is a private contractor. We work for the DoD. We advise them on xenoscience. Xenoscience? Alien technology. For example, the Superman ship. Eight people never signed out of the lab last night, Doctor. Cleaning staff, guards, a few of your research scientists. They were abducted. Are you sure? Witness saw it all. He escaped. Hes here in quarantine now, working on an ID sketch. Any idea who or what that might be? The box isnt safe here. Victor, they came looking for it at the lab. People were taken by some kind of monster or something. You know a lot about monsters, dont you? Especially how to make em. Mayday! Mayday, mayday! My hull is breached. Im going down. Mayday! Is there anybody out there? Ahh! Whiskey. Tell him to respect the storm next time. Its on him. King who would be man. Son of a human father and Queen of the Seas. All the time Ive wasted trying to keep the promise I made to your mother. Are you finished, old man? You never sleep in the same place twice, yet you keep coming back here. I like it. Its quiet. Its your inheritance. Youre the rightful king of Atlantis. Our people suffer. Your people. A brutal, petty, superstitious race. Is the surface any different? Nobody calls me King of the Surface. What do you want, Vulko? Guards near the stronghold have been disappearing. Snatchers from above. Talk to King Orm.  Your brother?  Halfbrother. Hes trying to fan the flames of war with the surface. He lies. The snatchers have come from the dark place. Theyre looking for it. The Mother Box our people guard is not safe. Go to the stronghold of Atlantis. Protect the box. The time has come. Take up your mothers trident. You cant turn your back on the world forever, Arthur. Above or below. DeSaad. DeSaad! I call to thee. Steppenwolf, have you begun the conquest? This world is divided. They are a primitive species. Unevolved and at war with one another. Too separate to be one. Their free will must be ripped from them, like the other worlds. Given absolution in one glorious belief, to serve him. The Mother Boxes? I have found one of the three. The one that woke and called to me. The other two still sleep, but the parademons feel their presence. They fly, they search, they take prisoners who carry the scent, while I build a stronghold in the name of his glory. Yes. Mighty Steppenwolf, who might have sat here by the side of the great one. But undone by his selfpride. DeSaad... I fall before you. Let me make a plea to him that I may come home after I take this world in his name. You betrayed him. Your own family. I saw my mistake. I slaughtered those who sought his throne. You still owe the great one 50,000 more worlds. He will hear your plea when you pay your debt. The Mother Boxes will be found and united. No protectors here. No Lanterns, no Kryptonian. This world will fall, like all the others. For Darkseid. For Darkseid. You know, I paid millions of dollars for this buildings security. You got your moneys worth. Took me almost a minute to disable it. Hi there. A new toy? Prototype troop carrier. I once knew a man who would have loved to fly it. The best minds at Wayne Aerospace couldnt make it fly. But you can? I have no choice. I need more range and I need more cargo. I think theres an attack coming. Not coming, Bruce. Its already here. From what Ive learned, they are things from another universe. They serve a dark power. An old power. What do they want? To invade. To conquer. They came here once before, long ago. A great armada appeared in the sky, laying waste to all who opposed it. The leader of the invaders was a being called Darkseid. A name cursed and feared in every universe. Darkseid was met in battle by Earths defenders. The old gods, men... Atlanteans before their descent into the sea... Amazons before their betrayal and enslavement and guardians from the stars. Their histories had taught them not to trust each other, not to hope for an alliance. To fight apart. As Darkseid waged war on Earth, he found a secret there. A power hidden in the infinity of space. He called forth mystics who worshipped and controlled three objects... the Mother Boxes. Wait, wait, wait. Mother Boxes? Indestructible living machines, made from a science so advanced, it looks like sorcery. To conquer, three boxes have to synchronize and join together into The Unity. The Unity cleanses a planet with fire, transforming it into a copy of the enemys world. All who live become servants of Darkseid. Alive but drained of life. Parademons. Amazons! With me! But before The Unity could synchronize, the defenders of Earth attacked and fought as one. Amazons alongside Atlanteans. Zeus and his son Ares alongside the guardians from the sky. A golden Age of Heroes fighting together to defend life on Earth. They did what no world had ever done. Sent the enemies back into the stars. The three Mother Boxes never synchronized. The Unity never came to pass. But, in their retreat, the boxes were left behind on Earth. They grew weak. Dogs without masters falling asleep, awaiting their return. Fading from the view of the enemy, anonymous among a trillion worlds. The defenders of Earth made a vow. Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons. Each would enshrine and guard one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes according to the rites and rituals of their culture in case a box should ever wake again to call out to the planet Apokolips to return and conquer the only world Darkseid had ever lost. Something woke the box my people guard. It called out to the dark place... to one of Darkseids conquerors. The enemy is here. If hes here, where is he? Hell be searching for the other two boxes. Hiding until he has all three. Until hes ready. Then we have to be ready. You, me, the others. They said the Age of Heroes would never come again. No, it will. It has to. The others. Where are they? Am I late? No, Im so late. Im very late. Oh, hey, buddy. Hey. Oh. No. Okay, bye. Okay. Im so sorry. Im late.  Are you, uh...  Im... Im so sorry Im so late. I didnt mean to be so late. Im me and Im here and Im so sorry Im late. Essentially, the bus didnt come, then the bus did come, but then there was this old woman counting change for the fare, like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny. Like, jeez Louise, let this woman on the bus. Shes 107 years old, these are some of her last few moments of life. Resume. Resume. Come on. Come on. From the French, of course. Resume, I believe, is a past participle of... Uh, wow. Thats no good. Its like, what lives in my pocket, right? Paper monster hungry. Uh... Come on. Supposed to be friends now. Yes. Central City College, Im a criminal justice major. You said you had experience walking dogs. Oh, gosh, I hope everyones okay. See, in times of crisis, for dog work, I always bring a meat snack. Cause it makes them feel calm. Cause you never know whats going to happen in this city. I mean, oh, my gosh. Right? I start on Monday? You have been near a Mother Box. The scent is on you. Where is it? No son or daughter of Atlantis will ever tell you. Our people have guarded the Mother Box for thousands of years. I will never betray my own people. You already have. This was taken in the deepest trench on Earth. He must be an Atlantean. A waterbreather. He was breathing air when I talked to him. Mixedblood, then. He said hell fight with us? More or less. More more or more less? Probably more less.  He said no?  He said no. Atlanteans can be tricky. My people went to war with them once. Im not sure we can trust him. Diana, if were gonna do this, youre gonna need to be open to more things that we didnt... you know...  Im sorry. Thats okay.  Sorry. My fault. Dont worry about it.  Lets...  It happens. so... This is the third person. Disappears for 130 of a second here. One frame of video, see? Barry Allen. Central City. Go to him. Ill work on number four. Organic and biomechatronic body parts. Hes a cyborg.  Ready!  Break! Three... eighty... set... go! Your son may be captain of the football team and a certified genius, Mrs. Stone... Dr. Stone. ...but that doesnt mean he can hack into our system to change his friends grades. Sarahs family lost their house this year. How could that child pass her classes? Victor helped her cause hes got a good heart. What did you do to help her?  Your father...  Mom, Mom, dont. He got held up at the lab. Okay. He always does. He wanted to be here. You always say that. Ma, you gotta stop making excuses for him. Youre just as busy as he is, but you still make the time. He just has difficulty showing it, but... I know hes proud of you. We both are, Victor. Hey, hey, hey. With everything I know you can do today, I cant wait to see what youre gonna be tomorrow. Dr. Stone, Im sorry, your wife didnt survive. Im afraid your son wont either. I wont let you die. I wont allow it. I wont allow it. Victor. Victor, youre not stuck in here. You still have a life ahead of you. Your mother would have wanted you to live that life. If you were there, Mom would still be alive. All right, look, you dont have to give me a second chance, but give yourself one. If you cant stand looking at me, try listening. What you can do now, Victor. Your physical strength is just the tip of the iceberg. The tip of the tip. In the world of ones and zeroes, you are the absolute master. No firewall can stop you. No encryption can defy you. Were all at your mercy, Vic. From our power grids to our telecommunications, everyones lives are controlled and dominated by complex digital networks that will bend without effort to your will. The fate of the world will literally rest in your hands. Its entire nuclear arsenal, you could launch with a thought. The worlds monetary systems and its complex interactions will seem as easy to manipulate for you as a childs plaything. The question... No, the challenge wont be doing it. It will be not doing. Not seeing. It is the burden of this responsibility that will define you and who you choose to be. Now, make a wish. One more time. Good job. Wave to Grandma! Hi, Grandma! What? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Victor... Victor, these are the words and deductions of a scientist. Thats how Ive been speaking to you. Now, let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist, as a father. Hey. Hey, you! Because you are holding yourself back. Youre going in circles, man. Holding down three deadend jobs, going on four. Where do you even find the time? I make the time.  I just need one more gig...  Barry. ...then Im gonna pay for my own tuition. You cant. Like I always said I would. You cannot keep doing this to yourself. Okay. I really dont wanna talk about this again.  Please, we have 10 minutes.  And this is all to pay for a criminal justice degree, huh? Yeah. For what? Huh, lets see. As I talk to my father, whos still in prison for the murder of my mother, which he didnt commit. Yeah, how did I get interested in criminal justice? I cant remember. Oh, boy. This path has clearly chosen me, Dad. Give me your hand, man. I want you to listen to me, Barry. I want you to listen to me, because I mean this. I want you to give all that up. And I want you to stop coming to see me. I am a drag on your life. Okay. Um... Please dont ever say that to me again. Please. Hey, you know what criminal justice would be for me? My son not wasting his life. You can be whatever you wanna be. Youre brilliant, man. Absolute best of the best. I cant sit here and watch you run in place in Central City for some old dude whos not going anywhere.  Dad, thats not true.  Its time. Thats not true. Lets go, Allen. Allen! I want you to make your own future. Youre living in the past. Make your own future. Open gate. Great. Youre living in the past. Make your own future, Barry. Clear. Close the gate. Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne. You said that like it explains why theres a total stranger in my place sitting in the dark, in my second favorite chair. Tell me about this. This is a person who looks exactly like me, but who is definitely not me. Somebody... I dont know. Hippie, long hair. Very attractive Jewish boy. Who drinks milk, I dont drink milk. I know you have abilities. I just dont know what they are. My special skills include viola, web design, fluent in sign language, gorilla sign language. Silicabased sand quartz fabric. Abrasion resistant, heat resistant. Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing. Its what they use on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning up on reentry. I do very competitive ice dancing. Look, man. I dont know who you are, but whoever youre looking for, its not me. Youre the Batman? So, youre fast. That feels like an oversimplification. Im putting together a team. People with special abilities. You see, I believe enemies are coming. Stop right there. Im in. You are? Just like that? Yeah. I need friends. Great. Great. Can I keep this? Its like this layer of dimensional reality, and it seems to manipulate spacetime. I call it the Speed Force. Causes me to burn a tremendous amount of calories so I am just a black hole of snacks. I am a snack hole. How many people are on this special fight team?  Three, including you.  Three? Against what? Ill tell you on the plane. Plane? What are your superpowers again? Im rich. Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that. No, thats okay. I can do it myself. Would you like to have some? Uh, no, thank you. If you put the water in first.  Of course.  So we dont scald the tea.  Yes.  Great. No, thats probably enough tea. All right. Are you sure you dont wanna have some? I wont, thank you. And then leave it to mash. I will. I will, definitely will. Uh... What are you working on? Its a gauntlet lined with specialized polymer solar cells.  Wow.  Here, let me show you. We borrowed this from the Kryptonian scout ship. Oh, maybe you should, uh... a fraction. Thank you, thank you. Of course. Ah. Ah, now, lets see how that did. Ha! Yes. Not to be sneezed at. A gauntlet that captures and dissipates energy. Its Master Waynes idea. Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?  In black, of course.  Oh. All right. Victor Stone. Something is not working. Mmm. Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince. Why are you looking for me, Diana? You know who I am. I know more than you can possibly imagine. Then maybe you already know I need your help. The world does. Fuck the world. Youve obviously been through a great deal. I cant begin to imagine what. But whatever happened to you, you have gifts now. Gifts? What part of this looks like a gift to you? We need you, Victor. And maybe you need us. I dont need anyone. Not anymore. I told myself the same for a long time. I lost someone I loved once. I shut myself off from everyone. But I had to learn to open back up again. The truth is, Im still working on it. And if you asked to meet me... youre working on it, too. You were right about the metal sample from the Superman ship. When we bombard it with Xrays from the electronlaser, look what happens. 3.5 million kelvin. The inner core of the metal becomes superheated. Hot, dense matter. Youre looking at the hottest thing on Earth. Exact words I said to my prom date. She dumped me anyway. Yeah. Hey, Doc, do you think Batman is connected to the object the CID is looking for? You know, 61982? No... I dont. Oh, Victor. All right! Lets go! Commissioner Gordon? Come on! Your messages. Hey, hey! Dont have to see the sky to know its a full moon. Half of Gothams realitychallenged community showed up. Say they saw flying monsters by the harbor. You were right, Ma. Police Academy. Whats wrong with dental school? Attacked by a flying vampire. Looked like a giant bat with huge fangs. On a possibly related note, sketch of the suspect in the abductions at the lab across the harbor.  Looks like...  I know what it looks like, Crispus. Come on, you think he fights criminals for 20 years here and then he goes to Metropolis and kidnaps eight people? Ill talk to him tonight. How, Jim? How do you think? Silas? Hey, hey. Hey, hey!  Oh, my goodness.  Wheres the cyborg? His name is Victor. We met, spoke. Give him time. You must be Barry. Im Diana. Hi, Barry. Im Diana. Thats not right. Great.  So, this is us.  Yeah, this is us. Oh! Awesome! Its the BatSignal. Thats your...  Oh, sorry.  Thats your signal. That means we have to go now.  Yeah, thats what that means.  Its so cool. Commander Mera, I told the king the perimeter guards were taken. He wont send reinforcements. He says all the reserves are needed in the rebel regions. Hes as shortsighted as he is cruel. All right, take what men we have left and form a phalanx around the Mother Box. You cant escape. Im not trying to. Vulko told me you would come. The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna. Wait. Please. I knew her. Well, that makes one of us. My parents died in the wars. She took me in. What a saint. You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way? Your queen left me on my fathers doorstep and never gave me another thought. Your mother left you to save your life. You cannot imagine how it hurt her. What it cost her. But youre not a defenseless child now. It would have been her responsibility to follow that monster to the surface and stop him. Now, its yours. Yes. Steppenwolf, tell me what youve learned. Two boxes found and awake. With the combined power of the two Mother Boxes, Ive been able to finish the strongholds defenses. Where is the third Mother Box? The parademons sense its presence and search for the third. They have taken prisoners who carry its scent. Go. Interrogate the prisoners. Find the third. They will tell me what they know, or I will rip it from them. How many of you are there? Not enough. Dozens of witnesses all over Gotham. Description matches the suspect in the Metropolis abductions. Parademons. Okay. The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box. At the lab. They carried people away to find out what they know. So the eight may still be alive. Nine. Oh. The head of STARLABS was taken tonight. Wow, okay. So, another scientist. So, how do we find him? There must be a nest nearby. I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham. No discernable pattern I can see. The lines on the map dont converge. On land. These lead back to Strykers Island, between the two cities. These are air vents. They all lead down to the tunnel to a Metropolis project that was abandoned in 29. The nest could be there. Uh, is he coming with us now, because were not all gonna fit in your car. I have something bigger. Do you really think that... Oh, wow, they just... They really just vanish, huh? Oh. Thats rude. Were close. The scent of the enemy. Of absence. Darkness. Death. Where are we, Alfred? Strykers Island. You should be directly under the venting tower for the tunnel. Now look to your left, youll see a staircase to the machine room. Thermal scan shows a cluster of people there. Thats it. Lets go. Right. Is there... Is there a plan? Either of you? Dont engage alone. We do this together. I heard about you. Didnt think you were real. Im real when its useful. I grow tired of your silence. Now tell me, where is the Mother Box? Please. We have families. Then you have weakness. Steppenwolf. Okay, Im guessing thats the bad guy. Good guess. Im really, really missing Superman right now. Circle to the other side. Well surround them and surprise him. You have been near a Mother Box. The scent is on you. I dont know what youre talking about.  Where is it?  Leave him alone! He... He doesnt know. Wait, please, please! You carry the scent, too. But stronger. I will die before I tell you. Youll die if you dont. No! Victor. Kill them both. Ah, Amazon. But not like your sisters. Stronger. Amazon. Hold! This one will be mine. I belong to no one. Guys, this is not together. Help get those people out of here. Ill make sure these things follow me. Everybody, move! A little quicker.  Are you good?  Yeah. Ive got this. Keep moving. This way. The energy is dissipating. My gauntlet worked! Celebrate later, Alfred. I need the Nightcrawler. Thought youd never ask. Crawlers on the way. Initiating remote mode. Thank you, Alfred. Dont mention it. No! Whew. Theyre safe. Get back to the tunnel. Tunnel. Right. Aliens, bad guy, sword lady. My turn. Catastrophic failure of all systems. Are you all right, Master Wayne? Are you all right? You have the blood of the old gods in you. You okay? Mm. Wasnt sure youd come. Youre my father. Go. No! Relax, Alfred. Ill take it from here. Uh, do I know you? What are we under, right now? Gotham Harbor. Who is that? Come on. Diana, get on! What is it? Show me. It is here. On this world. Sir, youre gonna be in quarantine for possible alien microbes. U.S. government protocols require that... I know the requirements. I wrote them. It called to him. The Mother Box. The one he already has. He has two. He took the Mother Box from Atlantis. All he needs now is the lost Box of Men. If he doesnt already have it. He doesnt have it. I do. Have you finished the conquest? Not yet, DeSaad. Then why do you summon me? I bring news. Before mighty Darkseid came to the throne, he searched the universe for the ultimate weapon. The AntiLife Equation. The key to controlling all life and all will throughout the multiverse. He found it hidden on a primitive planet, but before... The story of the defiance is wellknown. I have found the primitive planet. The world that fought back. It is Earth. The AntiLife Equation is carved into the surface of this very world. Are you certain? I have seen it. I have looked with my own eyes. AntiLife. My lord. Oh, Steppenwolf. My lord, I am but your humble servant. Can it be true that you have found it? I have, great one. The lost world is Earth. AntiLife is here. If it is redemption you seek, find the third box, synchronize The Unity, and when this world is scorched, I will come for my great prize. You will come to Earth? I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust looking for AntiLife. Looking for those who robbed me of my glory. I will stride across their bones and bask in the glow of AntiLife. And all of existence shall be mine. It shall be so, my master. So cool. From the outside, it looks like this building was abandoned. It wants to fly. You talk to machines? I speak to intelligence. This ones saying she cant fly because of a software issue, but I could fix it with a little time. Theres a dark spot in my data stream. I could feel the other two boxes. I know theyre awake, but I cant see where they are. Well, we cant attack unless we know where the base is. Even if we knew, Ive never seen a being as strong as Steppenwolf. Maybe one. Hmm, Superman. As long as the third box is asleep, they cant see it, only sense it. We need to keep moving so they cant catch up. No. Thats just a strategy to lose more slowly, not to win. Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing? Why dont we just destroy it? Fire doesnt destroy the boxes. Theyre an unknown form of matter. Oh, they love heat. They absorb it, hold it in their cores. Well, you know a lot about these boxes. Makes you think. Whered you find the box, Victor? Are you trying to say something? Oh, Im saying it. How do we know youre not working for them? Its a long story. You got somewhere else to be? The Nazis found the box at the end of the Second World War, buried under an Italian monastery. The Allies intercepted it on its way to Hitler. They brought it back to the States in 44. Unknown object 61982. It collected dust in the Pentagon archives for 70 years till DoD began to study the Superman ship. A researcher at STARLABS made a connection between the ship... and 61982. He understood they were both alien technologies. Different civilizations, similar properties. And though the box had slept for thousands of years, the researcher formulated a theory on how to awaken it. And so did. Then... I had an accident that shouldve killed me. But in an act of desperation or madness, the researcher harnessed the power of the Mother Box. He unleashed an alien technology he didnt fully understand. He used that power to keep me alive. Alive... but turned into this. The box went back to sleep and he never returned it. That researcher was Silas Stone. My father. Wait, your father saved your life with one of these things? Arent they psycho murder machines? Theyre change machines. The boxes dont think in terms of healing or killing, alive or dead. They rearrange matter at the will of their masters, regenerate, reinstate. Reinstate? A box has the power to reinstate anterior particle relationships. So, you mean in the way that particles of matter cant be created or destroyed, their relations just transform. Burn down a house, the particles still exist. Particles of house become particles of smoke. Anybody with a match can turn a house to smoke. But a Mother Box... ...turns smoke back into a house. I know were all thinking the same thing right now. Whos gonna say it? Im not gonna say it. Who is it? Martha. Hi. Hi. I went to the Daily Planet to finally pick up Clarks things. I dont know why, nowhere to put them now. I lost the farm. Id been behind on the payments for a while. Truth is, the house is too big for me to live in by myself anyway. Well, you know youre welcome to stay here any time for as long as you need. Thank you, Lois. Thats very kind. But Ive found a little place that suits me just fine, right by the diner. Im not here for help. Im here because when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that you havent been to work since Clark died. I cant. The whole world is mourning. Grieving over a symbol. Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I see that S. I hear what people say. They talk like they knew him. But they didnt know Clark. And I cant stop them and look at them and tell them how proud I am of my son. Youre the only one who knows. Who feels what I do. Burdened by a secret on top of grief. I came all this way because I wanted... because I wanted to see you. Tell you... I understand. I... will never love anybody the way that I love your son. And I just miss him. I miss him so much. So do I, sweetheart. Martha, you know if theres anything you need, Im here. There is something you can do for me, honey. Come back to the living. The world needs you, too, Lois. The dead are dead. The box brought Victor back. Victor wasnt dead. Life is either one or zero. Its to be or not to be. Not both. Can you operate this box, Victor? Of course. But we dont know enough about Kryptonian biology. Theres no telling whats gonna happen. Okay, but... I mean, we have to try. Dont we? We have to try. What do we have to lose? We cannot try unless we activate the box. As soon as it wakes up... ...the enemy sees it, comes, activates The Unity. The end. So, what we have to lose is the entire planet to a bunch of genocidal aliens. Thats good to know. Even if Superman could return, whos to say that he could defeat them? The Mother Box did. Victors father activated a Mother Box more than a year ago when Superman was still alive. Didnt call out to Steppenwolf. None of the boxes did. Not until... Not until Superman died. Not until Superman died. Its like they were afraid of him? Yes, they were afraid of him. This is the only way. There are six, not five. There is no us without him. Cross this one off the bucket list. Exhume Superman from the grave. Check. You know we could do this in a nanosecond, right? We could. He was my hero. All right. An Amazon working with an Atlantean. HalfAtlantean. How many thousands of years since our people spoke? I dont know. Im not exactly close to mine. I hate Atlanteans as much as you Amazons do. Hate is useless. Yep. No, thank you. You know, my father told me theres a saying in Atlantis... None are taken back from the darkness. Not without... Not without giving one up in return. We say the same thing. How about that? Wonder Woman. What do you think, man? You think shed ever go for a younger guy? Shes 5,000 years old, Barry. Every guys a younger guy. Jesus. Oh, Christ. Oh, bloody... Any luck? If by luck you mean chance in hell well get it flying today, then, no. No luck. Its okay. It doesnt matter. Were just gonna take the body to the Kryptonian ship. Its basically an organic computer. It can talk directly to the Mother Box. What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor? Something like that. Huh. What could possibly go wrong? Master Wayne... you did it! You put the team together to fight this war. Youve fulfilled your promise. But to try to do that... I mean... your guilts overcome your reason. Not all the kings horses nor all the kings men... Alfred, for once, Im operating strictly on faith, not on reason. But if you start playing with this little box of tricks, I mean, it could be the end of everything. How do you know your teams strong enough? If you cant bring down the charging bull, then dont wave the red cape at it. You do when its this red cape. This red cape charges back. Okay. You were right, Dr. Stone. The tests came back negative. Everyones clear, including you. Just to be on the safe side, we swept the entire facility. Well, thank you, Thomas. That means Im free to go? Absolutely.  Thanks.  Listen up, everyone. Youre all clear. So, gather your things. If you need more medical attention... Arthur, yes, your opinion. Less preposterous. Option A?  Definitely not A.  Okay. Or... B? Let me see A again? Right. We should get dressed. Im always dressed. ID? ID. Aye, aye. Aye, aye? Okay. Okay? Oh, gee, okay! Doc! They let you out of quarantine. Yeah, I finally got them to listen to reason. Now, lets take a look and see what progress weve made with the electronlaser. Weve made some real progress. Let me show you. Victor, clear this place out. Done. Code Red. Contamination breach. All personnel evacuate immediately. Bio red five. The sensors picking up a microbe of alien origin. A microbe of alien origin? That doesnt make any sense. Its gotta be a false alarm. All right, people, shut it down. Lets go.  Ryan, we just had it swept.  We have to go, Doc. Think about it. Its gotta be a false alarm.  Lets go, Doc.  Think about it. Full base evacuation! Everyone out! Look, wait! Wait! Shit! Remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit. Attention, all personnel. Go! Go! Everybody out! Come on! Move! Move! Come on! Go, go! Everybody out! Go! Yes! Gotcha! Post Commander, this is Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?  Go ahead, Dr. Stone.  This is a false alarm. Someone has hacked into the system. We must alert... Victor. Dr. Stone, you there? I dont copy. I was mistaken. The alarms legit. Everybody out. And nobody, I repeat, nobody comes back inside without my sayso. Roger that, sir. Get the civilians out! Lets go! Lets go!  Everybody got out okay?  I think so.  Everybody?  Yes. This way. It knows hes here. Ooh, thats intense. This is amazing. This is crazy. Oh, what? Now its crazy? You two lunatics better know what youre doing. Systems coming online. Welcome, Victor. Would you like to assume command? Im in. The ship says the Mother Box is hostile. I can override the security protocols, but theres no time to repair all the electrical damage that Luthors power surges caused to the primary capacitors. English. Theres not enough charge to wake the box. I might be able to do it. I mean, I might be able to jumpstart it. I dont like to break this rule, but when I approach the speed of light, I... Look, crazy things happen to time, but if I do it, I create massive electrical power. I could backtrack, if I can get enough distance, I can conduct a significant electrical current. I might be able to wake the box, if thats... still what we want? It is. Do it. Hey, Miss Lane. Morning. I didnt think you were coming. One last time. I see engines, so this must be the end of the line. So Im... Im in position. Ready to initiate drop sequence. The Mother Box is ready. The ships begging me not to wake the box. This action is irreversible. Its afraid. It knows Steppenwolf will come for it. We know that already. Continue. I strongly advise against activation. Barry, Im initiating the countdown. This action is irreversible.  Five...  Five...  Five...  Apokoliptian technology  is hostile.  This is a bad idea. No, it isnt. Keep going. Four...  Four...  Four... I strongly advise against activation.  We need to abort, now.  Just do it.  Three...  Three... Three...  Two...  Two...  Two...  This course is irreversible.  One.  One. One. This action is irreversible.  Victor?  No. Go? The future has taken root in the present. Get down! Hes back. Somethings wrong. Hes scanning us. What? Victor? Victor?  Shit.  What are you doing? Its my autodefense system. It senses danger. Victor, no! Victor!  I cant control it.  Dont! KalEl, no! Hes confused. He doesnt know who he is. Arthur, we need to restrain him. KalEl, the last Son of Krypton... remember who you are. Tell me who you... Lets go! You should probably move.  You all right?  Yeah. Get up. Take cover back there. Go. Please dont make me do this. Clark. Clark, no. Clark. No. This world needs you. Clark. Clark. Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Clark. Please. Please. Please. Just go. Yeah. Lets go. Im so sorry. Take cover!  Hes coming.  The Mother Box. Where is it? Come on. Come on. Attention, security breach detected. Sector Four, Level Three. Implement lockdown procedures immediately. Give me the Mother Box. No, no, no. Dad, wait! Dont! So begins the end. Victor? Vic... Whoa, Victor. Are you okay, man? Come on. Victor? Hes dead. What? My father. I didnt save him. I couldnt. Oh, my God. His fathers dead cause of us. I told you waking that box was a bad idea. It wasnt a bad idea. We needed Superman. We still do. Well, whatever returned, it isnt Superman. His body and powers, maybe. But it aint him. It is him. He recognized Lois Lane.  Who?  The woman he loves.  He remembers her.  Nah. He went to her cause she wasnt afraid of him. Its called instinct, Diana. Wait, where did Steppenwolf go? Hes gone back to his base to assemble the three boxes. And we dont know where his base is.  Or how long until...  Hours. The boxes synchronize, Unity forms, we dont get there in time to stop it, the planet dies. This is not your... He knew. He knew, he knew, he knew. He wasnt trying to destroy the box... he was trying to superheat it. He made the core the hottest thing on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor. Now, anything that hot would have to... Blink off the charts on a thermal imaging system. Your father sacrificed himself to mark that box. We have to get back to my lab and use the satellite to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies. Im already on it. Im sorry. You have a satellite? I have six. Right. Lets go find the son of a bitch. You brought us here. You remembered. This is home. You spoke. Did I not before? Your mother got behind on the payments. She never told anyone. I dont understand. Shes a proud woman, Clark. Here. She loved it here. So did I. So did I. Wow! This is awesome. Brought some friends. Oh, gosh, yes! Yes! Everyone, this is Alfred. I work for him.  Alfred.  Good day, maam. Oh... Its badass, Alfred. Well, Ill put on the tea. Great. I dont know where were gonna find the cups. Theres the Mother Box, right there. Go to visible spectrum. Pozharnov. Ghost city not far from Moscow. Its been abandoned since the nuclear accident there 30 years ago. Not even the army goes in. Right, its probably so radioactive that you grow an extra foot outta your neck. Not anymore. Hes harvested the radiation to build his base. Zoom. What the hell is he building? The Unitys in there. Well attack from above. Explosives wont separate the boxes, only strengthen their bond. What? So we cant blow it up? Not from the outside. I want to plug into The Unity, oneonone. Fuse with it. Weaken its bond from the inside so we can break it back into three. No, you dont know what youd be up against. Youd have to stream into The Unity by yourself. These boxes together are world destroyers. A billion years old. Theyll get inside you and find your weaknesses and your fears, and use them to destroy you. Just get me in and get me time. You could die, Victor. If I dont, we all die. Period. I got nothing left. You wanted me to use these gifts, right? Thats what Im gonna do. Okay. So... if Victor wants to try to save the world by fusing with the doom boxes, I say we put him in the doom boxes. But getting him in means attacking that base. Fighting the devil and his army in hell. I mean, this guys probably fought hundreds of thousands of other superbeings on the other planets hes destroyed, right? And we have to assume hes won. I dont care how many demons hes fought in how many hells... hes never fought us. Not us united. Take that as a yes. What? The ring. Youre really back. I have a second chance, Lo. And I am not gonna waste it. Are you really you? Im really me, Ma. Listen, Ma. They wanted me back for a reason. I need to find out why. Hows Victor doing? You know, wanted to be by himself. Were asking a kid who just lost his father to go up against the most powerful machines in the universe. Its not fair. I thought you didnt care? I never said that. What is it? Uh... I had a dream, like, I dont know, almost like a premonition. It was the end of the world and Barry Allen was right here and he said to me, Lois Lane is the key. She is... to Superman. Every heart has one. I think its something more. Something darker. Master Wayne. Master Wayne! You need to see this. You fixed it. It wanted to fly. Flight is its nature. Yours, too. Hell be here, Alfred, I know it. What makes you so sure? Faith, Alfred. Faith. At last. Prepare for his arrival. My redemption is nigh. Unite. The satellites revealed hes created a defensive dome. Its a design flaw. Take out the tower, the dome will fall. The enemy never anticipated a frontal assault. Right, probably cause he didnt think anyone would be that nuts. Bruce is right. Weve got to destroy the defensive dome so we can reach The Unity before it synchronizes. What if the domes not destroyed? Itll be destroyed. Once Victor is linked with The Unity with Barrys help, hell break through The Unitys defenses. Remind me, hows that again? Uh, with the power of love.  Barry.  With a catastrophic energy surge. Good. Youll have to run faster than youve ever attempted to generate a charge of that size. And then you make physical contact with Victor. That force should propel him inside The Unity. And, Victor, its all up to you. Take it apart from the inside before it synchronizes. Whew. We actually finally have a plan. We have a plan. The symbol of the house of El means hope. Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good. Clark... Thats what you can bring them. ...you were sent here for a reason. You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is. They will stumble, they will fall. Youre gonna have to make a choice. They will join you in the sun, Kal. A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not. You will help them accomplish wonders. All the hopes and dreams of Krypton live in you now. Im so proud of you, son. Your mother and I loved you. Your mother and I knew you would change the world. Your heart was tested. I know its been hard, Clark. But you gave hope to their world. You need to show them who you are. Love them, Kal. The way we loved you. Fly, son. Its time. Im gonna take out that tower and knock down that shield dome. Whatever you see, stick to the plan. Its why I brought you together. Bruce, pull back. Youre not gonna make it. Just have to knock a little louder. Kill him! Get to the carriage. Defend The Unity. Oh, shit. The towers down. Do you read me? Uh, yeah, loud and clear. Are you okay? Bruce? Bruce? Get to the reactor. Ill lure as many of these monsters  away from you as I can.  What does that mean? Dont worry about me. Get to The Unity. Theyre here. Bruce? Comm went dead. Lets go. Come on, follow me, you damn insects. Critical damage. You really are outta your mind. Youre welcome. My man. Yeah, we got this. You go do your thing. Im assuming youre Alfred. Master Kent. He said youd come. Now, lets hope youre not too late. Hey! Remember me? Round two? Hell yeah. Shall we? Tell me, Amazon, why did you abandon your own sisters only to cast your lot with these creatures clinging to their puny lives? You werent there to protect them from me. And, sadly, you could have. Barry, Im in position. Okay. I built the charge. You call it. Barry, on one. Three, two... Get the hell off me! Victor! Victor! I watched your island burn, your sisters begging for their lives. As did your mother. Liar. I cant maintain this! Victor! Victor, I cant hold this! For Darkseid. Not impressed. All right. KalEl. Barry, Im connected to The Unity. I need the charge to get inside. Barry? Barry, are you okay? Barry! I got the wind knocked out of me. Need a few seconds, thats all! Barry, where are you? Its almost synchronized! Okay, okay. Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry. Heal. Heal. Barry! Its too late. Oh, no. Hes here! Okay. Just gotta go faster than the speed of light. Far beyond the speed of light. You gotta break the rule, Barry, and you gotta do it now. Dad... whatever happens, I want you to know your kid was one of them, Dad. One of the best of the best. Make your own future. Make your own past. Its all right now. Weve been waiting for you, Victor. My broken boy. You dont have to be alone anymore. Well be together again. we can put it back, Vic. Make you whole again. Im not broken. And Im not alone. Superman! I told you Steppenwolf would fail. Yes. Yes, you did. My master, now that the Mother Boxes have been destroyed, how will you retrieve your great prize? AntiLife is found, DeSaad. And we will stop at nothing to possess it. Ready the armada. We will use the old ways. Your father twice over. Now, let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist, as a father. Your father twice over. I brought you into the world and back to it. You cant imagine how proud I am of who you are. Have always been. So many years with you I wasted. So many wrongs Ive left unrighted. Everything breaks, Victor. Everything changes. I gotta go see my father. The world is hurt. Broken. Unexchangeable. Ships all yours now, kid. Youre the boss. Ryan Choi, Director of Nanotechnology. Thats your thing. Uh, yep. Thats my thing. But the worlds not fixed in the past, only the future. The not yet. The now. Wow. Must be 100, 150 feet. Must be. Big round table. Six chairs, right there. But room for more. But room for more. God help us. The now is you. What? Its actually the worst job you can get in a crime lab. But, uh, my foots in the door. This is like a job job? Job job. Your foots in the door. Isnt that a thing people say? Your foots in the door. Yeah, thats something people say, man. His foots in the door!  Thats my boy, right there!  Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. Taught him nothing he knows.  Yes!  Dad, youre gonna get maced again. No stopping you now. Thanks, Dad. Now. Nows your time, Victor, to rise. Thank you is not enough for what you did. I just undid a mistake, thats all. How did you get the house back from the bank? I bought the bank. Congratulations, by the way. Do this. Be this. The man I never was. The hero you are. Take your place among the brave ones. The ones that were, that are, that are yet to be. Its time you stand, fight, discover, heal, love, win. The time is now. Ready? Come on, Stevens. All right, lets keep it moving. Keep going. Come on, Luthor. Lets go. Luthor. Open up two, Carl, please. Luthor. All right, stop jerking around, Luthor, or Im gonna have to come in there. Ah, there he is. Welcome aboard. Care for a glass of Gout de Diamants? I was just celebrating Gods return. Out of the ground and back up into the sky. I heard you were a few clowns short of a circus. I was, thank you, until the good doctors at Arkham helped me find some much needed clarity. Now, you volunteered to destroy the bat free of charge. Why the pro bono work? Its personal. Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye? You said you had something Id want? Youd better not be wasting my time. Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson? No, I wouldnt think of it. Uh, I have too much to live for. And more important things to do. But if you want the Batman, here is something that can help you. His name is Bruce Wayne. Hmm. On second thought, we do have something to celebrate. Good boy. Clear. How much further? Were almost there. Well, we need to hurry. We cant be out in the open much longer. Hell come for us. Let him come. Let the bastard come. Ill stab this through his heart for what he did to Arthur. I want to make him pay. I understand how you feel, Mera. You have no idea how I feel. But we have to stick to the plan to have any chance to make this right. Who have you ever loved? Au contraire, my little fish stick. He knows exactly what its like to lose someone he loves. You know, like, uh, a father, like a mother. Be very careful with the next thing you say. Like an adopted son. Isnt that right, Batman? Maybe, in a way, that smelly old flounder is right. Because how many can die in your arms before you grow numb to death? Thats not very careful. And how many dead eyes can you look into before you die inside yourself? Ive been dead inside a long time, but even I have a limit. And if you cross that line, I swear to God, I will... Before what, Bruce? Kill me? You wont kill me. Im your best friend. Besides, whos gonna give you a reacharound? Anyway, you need me. You need me to help you undo this world you created by letting her die. Poor Lois. How she suffered so! I often wonder how many alternate timelines do you destroy the world because... frankly, you dont have the cojones to die yourself. Hmm? So, as usual, Ill be the bigger man. A truce, Bruce. As long as you have this card, a truce. But all you have to do is tear it in half and Im happy to discuss with you in any way you like, why you sent the Boy Wonder to do a mans job? You know, its funny that you would talk about people who died in my arms because when I held Harley Quinn and she was bleeding and dying, she begged me with her last breath that when I killed you, and make no mistake, I will fucking kill you... that Id do it slow. Im gonna honor that promise. Oh. Youre good. You almost had me. Where are we holing up? Somewhere hell never suspect. Still think it was a good idea bringing him along? What do you think? Hes found us. Can I help you? Im sure you know Darkseid is not finished with Earth. The AntiLife Equation is here somewhere. We have to find it before he does. Theres a war coming. And Im here to help. Im sorry, who are you again? Ive gone by many names and taken many forms. And like you, Ive realized I have a stake in this world and its time I started fighting for it. Oh. Well, we could definitely use the help. So, glad youre here. You know, I never thought Id see the defenders of Earth united and fighting as one. It wouldnt have happened without you, Bruce. Your mother and father would be proud. I hope so. Well, Ill be in touch. Oh, and some have called me the Martian Manhunter. I guess Ill see you around. in your castle... ...forever, just like in a fairy tale. I just couldnt live with myself. Dont pretend this is a happy ending. Selina Kyle. Youre fired. And Bruce Wayne... ...why are you dressed up like Batman? Because he is Batman, you moron! Was. Dont. You killed me, the Penguin killed me, Batman killed me. Three lives down. Got enough to finish me off? One way to find out. Four. Five. Still alive! Six. Seven. All good girls go to heaven. Two lives left. Ill save one for next Christmas. But in the meantime... ...how about a kiss, Santie Claus? Shit! I picked a cute one. The heats getting to me. Ill murder you momentarily. But first... ...I need a cool drink... ...of ice water. Stop the car. Come what may... ...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne. Merry Christmas, Alfred. Goodwill toward men. And women.
