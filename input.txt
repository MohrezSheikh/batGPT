Three of a kind. Let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share.
Five shares is plenty.
Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice?
I know why they call him the Joker.
So why do they call him the Joker?
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?
Yeah! to scare people.
You know, war paint?
Alright everybody, hands up
heads down!
I said, hands up,
heads down!
Let's go pal! I'm
making a withdrawal here.
Put your hands up!
Here comes the silent alarm.
There it goes.
Heads down!
Get down. I said stay
down there!
That's funny it didn't dial out to 911.
I was trying to reach a private number.
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here ...
Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your
hands other than holding on for dear life.
On the ground! Stay on the ground!
Nobody make a move! Nobody!
Stay down!
Come here!
Do you have any idea who
you're stealing from?
You and your friends are dead!
He's out, right?
Where did you learn to count?
They wired this thing up with like 5000 Voltz.
What kind of bank does that?
A mob bank.
I guess the Joker is
as crazy as they say.
Where is the alarm guy?
The boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.
One less share, right?
Funny ... He told me something similar.
He what? No, no!
That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so
smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me as soon as we loaded the cash.
No, no, no, no ...
I kill the bus driver.
Bus driver?
What bus driver?
School's out. Time to go.
Cat's not getting up, is he?
That's a lot of money.
What happened to the rest of the guys?
You think you're smart, huh?
Well, the guy that hired you
will just do the same with you.
Ah, criminals in this town used
to believe in things.
Honor, respect! Look at you!
What do you believe in?
Huh, what do you believe in?
I believe whatever doesn't kill
you simply makes you...
stranger.
Mr. Mayor, you were elected in
the campaign to clean up the city.
When are you going to start?
Well, Mike, I believe I already have.
Like the so-called Batman? We're
hearing that he's doing some good.
That criminals are running scared.
But I say ...
Naw, man... I don't like it tonight.
What!, are you superstitious?
You got more chance of winning
the powerball than running into him.
That simply is not true.
I'm told that
Our men in the major crimes unit
are close to ...
Mayor says you're closing
in on the Batman.
The investigation is ongoing.
Ever intending to see your wife
again, lieutenant?
I thought you had to go
look after your mother, detective?
Checked her back into the hospital.
Sorry.
So he hasn't shown up?
I hope he doesn't.
I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.
Why wouldn't he come?
Hopefully because he is busy.
That's why we bring dogs.
Hey, my filhotinhos.
Look what your drugs
did to my customers.
Buyer beware. I told you
my compound would take you places.
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.
My business repeat customers.
If you don't like what I have to offer
you can buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from...
My dogs are hungry!
Pity there is only one of you.
That's not him.
That's more like it.
LOITER
INTIMIDATE
Don't let me find you out here again.
We are trying to help you.
I don't need help!
Not my diagnosis.
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?
I am not wearing hockey pads.
He can't resist showing us
his face.
What's he hiding
under that makeup?
Can we get a minute,
people, please?
Him again?
Where are the others?
Another bunch of smalltimers.
Some of the marked
notes I gave you.
My detectives have been making
drug busts with them for weeks.
This bank was another draft of the mob.
That makes five.
We found a bulk of the dirty cash.
Time to move in.
We would have to hit all banks
simultaneously. Swat teams, backup.
What about this Joker guy?
One man or the entire mob?
He can wait.
When the new DA hears
about this they want in.
Do you trust him?
It'd be hard to keep him out.
I hear he is as stubborn as you are.
It would be nice when Wayne
manor is rebuilt.
If you can swap not sleeping in a penthouse
you're not sleeping in a mansion.
Whenever you stich yourself up
you do make a bloody mess.
Yeah. It makes me
learn from my mistakes.
You ought to be pretty
knowledgable by now.
My armor. Carrying too
much weight. I need to be faster.
I'm sure Mr. Fox
can oblige.
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
It was a dog.
-- Ah?
-- It was a big dog.
More copycats last night,
Alfred. With guns.
Why don't you hire them
and take a weekend off?
That wasn't ... exactly what I had in mind
when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know.
But things have improved.
Look at the new district attorney.
I am. Closely.
I need to know if he can be trusted.
Are you interested in his character
or ... his sexual circle?
Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.
I trust you don't have
me followed on my day off.
If you ever took
one I might.
Know your limits, master Wayne.
The Batman has no limits.
But you do, sir.
Well, I can't afford to know them.
What's going to happen on
the day that you find out?
We all know how much you
like to say: "I told you so"
On that day, Master Wayne, even
I won't want to. Probably.
Sorry I'm late, folks.
Where were you?
Worried you'd have to step up?
Harvey, I know these
briefs backwards.
Fair's fair.
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.
Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin
to see who leads?
It's my father's lucky coin.
As I recall, it got me my
first date with you.
You wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.
I don't.
I make my own luck.
All rise!
The Honorable Judge Surrillo presiding.
I thought the DA just plays
golf with the mayor or things like that.
Tee-off is 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Salli.
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have
stepped up to run this so-called family.
Is that man in this courtroom today?
Could you identify him for us please?
You win counselor.
It was me!
I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man,
Salvatore Maroni, is the new
head of the Falcone crime family.
Maroni? He is a fallguy!
I'm the brains of the organization.
Order, order!
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.
Granted.
Hostile?
I'll show you hostile!
Carbon fiber,
.28 caliber, made in China.
If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni,
I recommend you buy American..
Get him out of here!
But, your honor, I'm not done!
We will never be able to link
the gun to Maroni,
so we won't be able to
charge him, but the fact
they are trying to kill you,
means we are getting to them.
Well I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel.
And I'm fine, by the way.
Come on Harvey, you are Gotham's DA!
If you are not getting shot at
you're not doing your job right.
You know,he said if you were rattled
you could take the rest of the day off.
I can't, I dragged the Head of
the major crimes unit down here.
Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually,
try to be nice!
I hear you got a
hell of a right cross.
It's a shame that
Salvatore's gone walk.
Yeah, well good thing about the mob is
They keep giving you second chances.
Lightly radiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.
Have help?
We have links with various agents ...
Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on site.
Uhum ... And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?
If you've got problems
with malfunctioning equipment,
I suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor.
I put every known money launderer
in Gotham, behind bars,
but the Mob is still getting its money.
I think you and your friend,
have found the last game in town
and are trying to hit them where it hurts:
their wallets. That's bold.
You gonna count me in?
In this town the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.
Gordon, I don't like that you've got your
own special unit and
I don't like that is full of cops
I investigated at internal affairs.
If I had to work with cops you investigated
while you were licking your
name at IIIP working alone.
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.
I have to do the best I can
with what I have.
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure
on five banks without telling
me what we're after?
Well, I can give you
the names of the banks.
Well, that's a start ...
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.
You don't have to sell me Dent. We all
know you're Gotham's white knight.
I heard they have a different name
for me down at MCU.
I wouldn't know about that.
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.
The joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.
Well, Mr Lau I speak
for the rest of the board ...
And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished
But frankly ...
This is embarrasing!
You worry about the delegace
Mr. Reese
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
It's done.
The numbers are solid.
Do them again. Wouldn't want the
trust fund to run out, now would we?
Another long night? This joint venture
was your idea and the consultants love it.
But I am not convinced. Lau's company
has grown by 8% anually like clockwork.
His revenue stream must be
off the books. It may be even illegal.
OK cancel the deal.
You already knew?
I just needed a closer look at their books.
Anything else you can trouble me for?
I need a new suit.
Yeah ... 3 buttons is a little
I am not talking fashion
Mr Fox, so much as function.
-- Want to be able to turn your head?
-- Sure would make
backing out of the driveway easier.
I will see what I can do.
It took me 3 weeks to
get a reservation here.
And I had to tell them
I work for the government.
Really?
This city health inspector is
not afraid to pull strings.
Rachel!
Fancy that!
Yeah Bruce, fancy that.
Rachel, Natasha.
Natasha, Rachel.
-- Natasha, are you the. ..
-- The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet.
Wow, Harvey's
taking me next week.
Really?
So you're into ballet?
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.
Well, I certainly hope not.
So, let's put a couple of tables together.
-- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
-- Oh they should. I own the place.
How could want to raise children
in a city like this?
Well, I was raised here
I turned out OK.
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?
The Palisades.
You know as our new DA,
you might want to figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.
Gotham needs heroes
like you, elected officials.
And not a man who
thinks he's above the law.
-- Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
-- We did.
All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.
But this is a democracy, Harvey.
When their enemies were at the gates,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was considered a public service.
Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the republic was named Caesar,
and he never gave up his power.
OK, fine.
You either die a hero ...
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.
Look whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to do this for the rest of his life.
Batman is looking for someone
to take up his mantle.
-- Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
-- Maybe. If I'm up to it.
-- What if Harvey Dent is
the caped crusader?
-- If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would have noticed by now.
Well ... I'm sold that I'm going
to throw you a fundraiser.
That's nice of you Bruce, but
I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.
No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals,
you'll never need another cent.
What the hell is this?
As you all are aware, one of
our deposits was stolen.
A relatively small amount.
Who is stupid enough to steal from us?
purple suit and makeup.
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well placed sources,
we know that police have
indeed identified our banks
using marked bills and are planning
to seize your funds today.
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business,
I'm your only option.
So what do you propose?
Moving all deposits
to one secure location.
-- Not a bank.
-- Where then?
Nobody can know, but me.
If the police were to gain leverage over one
of you, everyone's money would be at stake.
What stop them getting to you?
I go to Hong Kong.
Far from Dent's jurisdiction
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.
How soon can we move the money?
I already have.
For obvious reasons, I couldn't
wait for your permission.
Rest assured your money is safe.
And I thought my
jokes were bad.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.
How about a magic trick?
I'm going to make
this pencil disappear.
Tahdah! It's Gone!
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.
You ought to know,
you bought it!
Easy.
I want to hear the opposition.
Let's wind the clock back a year.
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare
cross any of you.
What happened?
Did your balls drop off?
-- You see a guy like me ...
-- A freak!
A guy like me ..
I know why you choose to have
group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
The Batman. Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.
Dent, he's just the beginning.
And as for the television's
so-called plan ...
The Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.
I know the squealers when I see them.
-- What do you propose?
-- It's simple. We kill the Batman.
If it is so simple why
haven't you done it already?
If you are good thing at something,
never do it for free.
And what you want?
Hm ... Half.
-- Are you crazy!
-- No I'm not ... No, I'm not.
If we don't deal with this now,
soon little Gamble here
won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma.
Enough from the clown!
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Do you think you can
steal from us and just walk away?
I'm putting a word out: 500 grand
for this clown dead.
A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners first.
Alright, so listen.
Why don't you give me a call when
you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously? Here's my card.
You're a hard man to reach.
Lau is halfway to Hong Kong.
If he had asked,
I could have taken his passport.
I told you to keep me in the loop.
All that was left in the vaults were
marked bills. They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved ...
My office?
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking ...
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beef.
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.
We need Lau back.
But the Chinese won't extradite
a National under any circumstances.
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing.
We're going after the mob's life savings.
Things will get ugly ...
I knew the risk
when I took this job, lieutenant.
How will you get him back ...
He does that.
Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.
Well I'm sure you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.
What's wrong with a phone call?
I think Mr Lau
deserves a more ... personal touch.
Now for high altitude jumps, you're
gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.
But what about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent.
Without it landing.
Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.
The ClA had a program back in the 60's for getting
their people out of hot spots called skyhook
You could look into that.
Okay, now.
Hardened Kevlar plates over
titanium-tipped
triweaved fibers for flexibility.
You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.
Perhaps you should read the instructions first.
Now there is a tradeoff.
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
We wouldn't want to make
things too easy now, would we?
How will it hold up against dogs?
We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas?
It should do fine against cats.
I found one in Arizona.
An very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he'd take the cash.
What about a flight crew?
South Korean smugglers; they run flights
into Pyongyang below radar the whole way.
Did you think of an alibi?
Oh, yes.
Presentation cancelled
I believe this is your plane, sir!
You look tired, Alfred.
Will you be all right without me?
If you can tell me the Russian for:
Apply your own bloody suntan lotion.
Yo Gamble, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.
And they brought the body.
Dead, that's 500 ...
How about alive?
You want to know how I
got these scars?
My father was a drinker and a fiend.
One night he goes off
crazier than usual
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.
He does not like that.
Not one bit.
So, me watching, he takes the
knife to her, laughing while he does it.
He turns to me and he says:
Why so serious, son?
He comes at me with the knife ...
Why so serious, son? He sticks
the blade in my mouth:
Let's put a smile on that face!
Why so serious?
Now, our operation is small but there is a
lot of potential for aggressive expansion.
So, which of you fine gentleman
would like to join our team?
There's only one spot open right now.
So we're going to
have tryouts?
Make it fast.
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.
Mr Lau regrets he isn't able
to greet you in person today.
I understand.
For security purposes, I'm going to
have to ask you to check in your mobile.
Of course
I must apologize for leaving
Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force.
I couldn't let such a thing
threaten my company.
Of course.
A businessman of your stature
will understand
that with you here now,
we can continue.
Well I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style Mr Lau ...
-- We do not allow cell phones in here.
-- Oh sorry, forgot I had it.
I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.
We can't afford to be seen to do business
with ... whatever it is you're accused of being.
I'm sure a businessman of
your stature will understand.
I think Mr Fox, a
simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr. Wayne didn't want
you to think that
he was deliberately
wasting your time.
Just accidentally wasting it.
That's very good Mr Lau.
Accidentally, very good.
Hey, sir!
A better view from the train.
-- How's the view from LSl hallways?
-- Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.
-- What is this?
-- I had RND work it up.
It sends out a high frequency pulse
records in response time.
For mapping an environment.
-- Sonar, just like a ...
-- a submarine, Mr. Wayne.
-- And the other device?
-- It's in place.
Mr Wayne, good luck.
Where are the police?
They are coming.
Then what the hell
am I paying them for?
Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.
The money is the only reason
I am still alive.
Oh, you mean when they find out
that you've helped us they're going to kill you?
Are you threatening my client?
No, I'm just assuming your
client's cooperation with this investigation.
As well everyone.
No?
Okay.
Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau.
Wait.
I won't give you the money.
But I will give you my clients.
All of them.
You were a glorified accountant. What could you
possibly have on all of them that we could charge?
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all the investments.
One big pot.
-- Got it.
-- One minute.
If they pull their money we can
charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.
Charge them with what?
In a Reiko case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony, you can ...
Charge all of them with it. That's great.
Mr Lau. What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?
Edgers, notebooks ...
Immunity, protection and a
chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
After you testify in open court.
And I'm just curious.
with all your clients locked up,
what's going to happen with all that money?
Like I said, I am
good with calculation.
He can't go to county,
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
What is this Gordon, your fortress?
-- Do you trust them over at county?
-- I don't trust them here.
Lau stays.
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.
He would, we should
have hired the clown.
He was right, we have to
fix real problem. Batman.
I'm not aware of any participation
by the Batman in the investigations.
Our boy looks good on the tube
You sure you want to embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant?
No, don't worry.
They're coming too.
Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall.
How do the defendants plead?
Order in court.
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
She shares my enthusiasm
for justice. After all she is a Judge.
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convinctions out of Surrillo,
you're going to set a new record
in appeals for quickest tick in the ass.
It won't matter, the head guys make bail,
sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't.
They can't afford to be off
the streets long enough for trial and appeal,
they'll cut deals that include some jailtime.
Think of all you can do
with 18 months of clean streets.
Mr. Mayor, you can't ...
Get out, both of you.
Sit down.
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.
But that means it's on you. They are all going
to come after you now and not just the mob.
Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone
whose wallet is about to get lighter.
Are you up to it? You better be,
because if they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the streets ...
Followed swiftly by you and me.
I think your fundraiser will
be a great success sir.
And why do you think I want to
hold a party for Harvey Dent?
Well, I assumed it was your
usual reason for socializing
beyond myself and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly.
To try to impress Miss Dawes.
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.
The police disclosed the footage
found at scene of the body.
Sensitive viewers please be aware:
the image is disturbing.
-- Tell them your name.
-- Brian.
-- Are you the real Batman?
-- No! No!
Then why do you dress up like him?
-- He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you!
-- Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do!
So you think Batman has
made Gotham a better place?
You see this is how crazy
Batman has made Gotham.
If you want to order in Gotham the Batman
must take off his mask and turn himself in!
And every day he doesn't,
people will die!
Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld,
scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.
-- I'll be back.
-- Rachel!
A little liquid courage,
Mr Dent?
-- Alfred, right?
-- That's right, sir.
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her for her whole life?
Not yet, sir.
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?
Oh, you have no idea!
I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.
Now, where is Harvey?
Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour!
And where's Rachel Dawes,
she is my oldest friend. Come here.
When Rachel first told me that she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:
"The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign
commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent? "
Yeah nice slogan, Harvey.
But you caught Rachel's attention.
Then I started to pay attention to Harvey
and all that he's been doing as our new DA.
And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.
I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer.
A little more optimistic.
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you are making fun of him.
but I do.
No, I meant every word.
You know that day that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer need Batman?
-- It's coming.
-- Bruce ...
-- You can't ask me to wait for that.
-- It's happening now.
Harvey is that hero.
He locked up half of the city's criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask.
Gotham needs a hero with a face.
You throw a party Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.
You mind if I borrow Rachel?
Lieutenant, that Joker card
pinned to the body?
Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.
-- Any matches?
-- All three.
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb.
The Joker is telling us
who he's targeting.
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?
City Hall.
Seal the building.
No one in or out until I get there.
Got it.
-- Gordon! What are you up to?
-- We're secure.
I want a floor by floor
search of the entire building.
Sorry sir, we believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.
These are dangerous people, Judge.
Yes, but you're not
giving me an awful lot of information.
-- Even we don't know where you're going.
-- Take the envelope.
Get in, open it. It'll tell
you where you're headed.
You can not leave me alone
with these people.
The whole mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?
Compared to this,
the mob doesn't scare me.
Gordon, you're unlikely
to discover this for yourself, so..
Take my word, the Police Commissioner
there's a lot of threats.
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah, it makes you think
about things you couldn't stand losing.
About who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.
It's a pretty big commitment.
Well, not if the Mob has their way.
It'd be good to explain to my wife
why I'm late for dinner tonight.
Sir, the Joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.
-- Don't do that.
-- Alright. Let's be serious then.
-- Okay.
-- What's your answer?
I don't have an answer.
How'd they get my DNA?
Somebody with access to your
office or your house
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass...
Wait!
-- I guess the answer is no.
-- Harvey ...
-- It's someone else, isn't it?
-- Harvey!
Just tell me it's not Wayne,
the guy's a complete
What are you doing?
Get a medic!
We made it!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are tonight's entertainment!
I only have one question.
Where is Harvey Dent?
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?
Hands up, pretty boy!
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him about something,
something little.
No. ..
-- What's going on out there?
-- Wayne!
Ah, thank God you've
got a panic room. Wait!
You got to be kidding me.
-- You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
-- We're not intimidated by thugs!
You know, you remind me of my father.
-- I hated my father!
-- Okay stop!
Well, hello beautiful!
You must be Harvey's squeeze!
And you are beautiful.
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?
You want to know how I got them?
Come here.
Hey!
Look at me.
So I had a wife, beautiful, like you,
who tells me I worry too much.
Who tells me I ought to smile more.
Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks
One day, they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again, hmm?
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.
So... I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this... to myself
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves.
Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling!
A little fight in you.
I like that.
Then you're going to love me.
-- Drop the gun.
-- Oh, sure!
You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are.
-- Let her go.
-- Very poor choice of words!
Are you alright?
Let's not do that again ...
-- Is Harvey okay?
-- He's safe.
Thank you
Jim, it's over!
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.
But the prosecution is over!
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges
and police commissioners are getting blown away.
What about Dent?
If he's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mexico.
So where do you keep your trash?
You're due at court.
I need you alive long enough
to get you under record.
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.
If you refuse to cooperate you're
not coming back here, you go to county.
How long you calculate
you'll last in there?
Targeting me won't get
their money back.
I knew the mob wouldn't go down
without a fight, but this is different.
-- They've crossed the line.
-- You've crossed the line first,sir
You squeezed them, you hammered
them to the point of desperation.
In their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.
Criminals aren't complicated Alfred.
We just need to figure out what he's after.
With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this
is a man you don't fully understand either.
A long time ago I was in Burma.
My friends and I were working
for the local government.
They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by
bribing them with precious stones.
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit.
So, we went looking for the stones.
But in 6 months we never met
anyone who traded with him.
One day, I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.
-- The bandit had been throwing them away.
-- So why steal them?
Well, because he thought
it was good sport.
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.
Some men just want
to watch the world burn.
Get the names.
-- Richard Dent
-- Patrick Harvey
Harvey Dent.
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.
Us contaminate it? It's because
of you these guys are dead ...
Detective!
Just a minute guys.
It's brick underneath.
You going to take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?
No.
Fingerprints.
Obituaries.
Mayor Anthony Garcia.
Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.
I'm not sure you
made it loud enough, sir.
What can I do for you Mr Reese?
You wanted me to do the
diligence on the LSI holdings deal again.
-- Well, I found some irregularities.
-- Our CEO is in police custody.
No, not with their numbers
With yours.
Applied sciences.
A whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared, overnight.
I went down to the archives and
I started pulling some old files.
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.
Now you got the entire RND
department burning through cash
claiming it's related
to cellphones for the army?
What are you building for
him now, a rocket ship?
I want 10 million dollars
a year for the rest of my life.
Let me get this straight.
You think that your client, one of the
wealthiest, most powerful men in the world
is secretly a vigilante, who spends his
nights beating criminals to a pulp ...
... with his bare hands.
And your plan is to blackmail this person?
Good luck.
Keep that.
This is your original scan.
Here it is re-engineered.
And there's the thumbprint he left when
he pushed the round in the clip.
I'll get you a copy.
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND?
Yes, government
telecommunications project.
I wasn't aware we had any
government contracts.
Lucius, I'm playing
this one pretty close to the chest.
Fair enough.
With no word from the Batman.
Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb.
These cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on
his threat in the obituary column of
the Gotham Times to kill the mayor.
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.
Cross reference the addresses. Look
for Park Side, overlooking the parade.
I got one! Melvin White,
Aggravated his soul,
moved to Arkham twice.
How many you got on the roof?
We're tight but frankly
there's a lot of windows up here!
Commissioner Loeb
dedicated his life to
law enforcement and to
the protection of his community.
I remember when I first took office,
I asked him if
he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and...
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been
A number of policies that
he enacted were unpopular.
Policies that flooded
my office with angry calls and letter ...
-- Who is it?
-- What happened?
They took our guns and uniforms.
We must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.
Standby, Honor, Guard, Atten-hut.
Ready
Aim
Fire!
Ready, aim ...
Ready, aim ...
Get him out!
-- I'll see you later!
-- Why are you coming back?
Get out!
Tell me what you
know about the Joker.
-- No!
-- I'm sorry Barbara.
Junior, go play with
your sister, go ahead.
If there is anything that
I can do, we're here for you.
Are you happy ..Are you
You brought this craziness on us ... You did!
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us.
May God help whoever
he does want to talk to.
Can we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.
Why makes you think
I want to hear you talk?
What?
-- Harvey, where are you?
-- Where are you?
I'm where you should be at MCU
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.
Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
Rachel, listen to me.
You're not safe there.
-- Oh, this is Gordon's unit.
-- Gordon's gone, Rachel.
-- He vouched for these men.
-- And he's gone.
The Joker has named you next.
Is there anyone in this
town we can trust?
Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.
No Rachel, I know
you're his friend but ...
Harvey, Trust me.
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.
Then you go straight there. Don't tell
anybody where you're going. I'll find you there.
I love you.
I want the Joker.
From one professional to another, if you're
trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.
I'm counting on it.
Where is he?
I don't know where he is.
He found us.
-- He must have friends.
-- Friends? Have you met this guy?
-- Someone knows where he is!
-- Nobody's going to tell you nothing.
He was right.
You got rules. The Joker...
He's got no rules.
Nobody's going to cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.
Just take off that mask
let him come find you.
Or are you going to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up your mind.
You want to play games?
How's that feel?
-- Don't kill ...
-- I wouldn't?
You don't think I will?
You don't think I will?
No, I wouldn't.
That's why I'm not going
to leave it up to me.
Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails, not so lucky.
So, you want to tell me about the Joker?
-- Let's go again.
-- I don't know anything, I don't!
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.
-- You'd leave a man's life to chance?
-- Not exactly.
His name is Shif, Thomas.
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.
The kind of mind
that Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's going to kill Rachel!
You are the symbol of hope
I could never be.
Your stand against organized
crime is the first
legitimate ray of light in
Gotham in decades.
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.
All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released
and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.
-- You're going to hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.
-- Why?
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands now.
You can't.
You can't give in.
You can't give in!
Harvey called.
He said Batman's going to turn himself in.
I have no choice.
Do you honestly think that's going to
keep the Joker from killing people?
Maybe not, but I have
enough blood on my hands.
I have seen now what I would have to
become to stop a man like him.
You once told me that if
the day came when I...
was finished, then we would be together.
Bruce, don't make me your
one hope for a normal life.
Did you mean it?
Yes.
If you turn yourself in, they're
not going to let us be together.
-- Logs as well?
-- Everything.
Anything that can
lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
People are dying Alfred.
What would you have me do?
-- Endure ... master Wayne.
-- Take it .... They'll hate you for it.
But that's the point of Batman,
he can be the outcast.
He can make the choice that
no one else can make, the right choice.
Well today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.
Today you get to say
"I told you so."
Today, I don't want to.
But I did bloody tell you.
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
As your accomplice...
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for coming.
I've called this
press conference for two reasons.
Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham that
everything that can be done over
the Joker killings is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.
But first, let's consider the situation.
Should we give into
this terrorist's demands?
-- Do we really think that ...
-- Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante
... than the lives of citizens?
The Batman is an outlaw.
But that's not why
we're demanding he turn himself in.
We're doing it because we're scared.
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.
Things are worse than ever!
Yes they are ...
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.
And I promise you ...
the dawn is coming.
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken.
But to us, not to this madman!
No more dead cops!
He should turn himself in!
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.
I am the Batman.
Alfred!
Why is he letting Harvey do this?
-- He went down to the press conference.
-- I know, and he just stoodby!
Perhaps both Bruce and
Mr. Dent believe the Batman
stands for something more important than
the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes.
Even if everyone hates him for it.
That's a sacrifice he's making.
He's not being a hero.
He is being something more.
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey
take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
-- You know him better than anyone.
-- I do.
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right.
-- How will I know?
-- It's not sealed.
-- Bye Alfred.
-- Goodbye Rachel.
Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you ...
What are you doing?
They're transferring me
to Central holding.
This is the Joker's chance. And when
he attacks, the Batman will take him down.
Listen to me, this is too dangerous!
We get this guy to county,
he's their problem.
The streets will be cleared
along your route. Let's go!
Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason!
I hope you got some moves pal.
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.
-- He's failed so far.
-- How do you know what he's looking for?
I just, I do!
Anyway Harvey,
this isn't just about you.
What about all the people who are depending on
you to clean the city up and to do it honorably?
Harvey, tell everyone the truth.
Heads, I go through with it.
This is your life! You can't leave
something like that to chance.
I'm not.
You make your own luck.
Hey! You wait like
everyone else, pal.
What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!
Damn it! All units, divert down onto
lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.
-- Exit down!
-- Lower 5th? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.
Come on. Get us out of here.
Let's go
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.
We got trouble, guys.
Lock and load!
What the hell was that?
These things were
built for that, right?
He's going to need something
a lot bigger to get through this.
What is that?
What is that? A bazooka!
I didn't sign up for this!
Look out.
Down!
Come on! Let's go!
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent!
Excuse me, I want to drive.
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.
We got to get topside.
We need air support now.
I like this job! I like it!
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.
Goodbye.
We're on point! Ready to give them
some of their own medicine.
That's what I'm talking about.
Aircabs.
Okay! Rack 'em up, rack 'em up,
rack 'em up!
That's not good.
Okay, That's not good!
Now there is the Batman.
Oh, you want to play!
Come on.
Come on ...
He missed!
You can't stop here!
We're like sitting ducks!
Come on ... Come on ...
I want you to do it.
Come on!
Hit me ... hit me!
Hit me!
Could you please just give me a minute?
We got you,
you son of a bitch.
Gordon ... You do like to
play things pretty close to the chest?
We got him, Harvey.
Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
No. I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.
But you and your office have been
working with the Batman all along?
No. But I trusted him to do
the right thing. Saving my ass.
Alright people! That's enough.
Let him be.
Thank you, detective. I got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.
Thank you, counselor.
Stay away! All of you.
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer
to use, you understand?
Back from the dead?
I. .. I couldn't risk my
family's safety.
What do we got?
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental.
Clothing is custom, no labels.
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
No name, no other alias.
Go home, Gordon. The clown will keep til morning.
Go get some rest. You're going to need it.
Tomorrow you take the big job. You don't have
any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon.
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk ...
-- Heads up big bastards!
-- I don't feel good...
You're a cop killer.
You're lucky to be feeling
anything below the neck.
Police!
Stay away from the bars!
My insides hurt.
Did Batman save you, Daddy?
Actually this time I saved him.
Has he said anything yet?
Evening ... Commissioner.
Harvey Dent never made it home.
Of course not.
What have you done with him?
Me? I was right here.
Who did you leave him with?
Your people?
That's assuming of course that they
are still your people, and not Maroni's.
Does it depress you, commissioner?
To know just how alone you really are?
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
Where is he?
What's the time?
What difference does that make?
Well, depending on the time,
he may in one spot or several.
If we're gonna play games...
I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?
Not exactly.
Never start with the head, the victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel ...
See?
You wanted me. Here I am.
I wanted to see what you would do.
And you didn't disappoint.
You let five people die.
Then you let
Dent take your place.
-- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
-- Where's Dent?
Those mob fools want you gone
so they can get back to the way things were.
But I know the truth.
There's no going back.
You've changed things ... Forever.
Then why do you want to kill me?
I don't want to kill you!
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off mob dealers?
No, no. No! You .. complete me.
You're garbage. You kill for money.
Don't talk like
one of them. You're not!
Even if you'd like to be. To them you're
just a freak. Like me.
They need you right now.
When they don't,
they'll cast you out.
See there are morals, your code ...
it's a bad joke.
Dropped at the first
sign of trouble.
They are only as good as
the world allows them to be.
I'll show you. When the chips are down
these civilized people,
they'll eat each other.
See, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.
Where's Dent?
You have all these rules
and you think they'll save you.
He's in control.
I have one rule.
Oh .. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth. .
Which is?
The only sensible way to live
in this world is without rules.
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.
I'm considering it.
No, there's only minutes left, so you're gonna have to
play my little game if you want to save one of them.
You know for a while there I thought you really
were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her ...
Look at you go?
Does Harvey know about
you and his little bunny?
Where are they?
Killing is making a choice.
Where are they?
Choose between one life or the other.
Your friend, the DA, or his blushing bride-to-be?
You have nothing to threaten me with.
Nothing to do with all your strength.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you where they are.
Both of them. And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.
He's at 250 52nd street.
And she's on Avenue X, at Cicero.
-- Which one you going after?
-- Rachel.
We're getting Dent!
Hello! Can anybody hear me?
Hello!
-- Rachel?
-- Harvey!
Oh, Harvey! Thank God!
Are you okay?
I'm alright. I'm in a warehouse.
They've got me wired to these oil drums.
I am too.
Harvey ...
I want...I want my phone call.
I want my phone call!
I want my phone call.
That's nice.
How many of your friends have I killed?
I'm a twenty year man.
I know the difference between punks
who need a little lesson in manners...
and the freaks like you
who just enjoy it.
And you've killed six of my friends.
Please. My insides hurt.
I don't really care! Back away.
The boss said that
he'd make the voices go away.
He said he'd go inside and
replace them with bright lights.
Like Christmas!
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off!
Medic right away in the holding
deck. Come on, get the door open.
You guys back off!
Listen, we don't have a lot of time. He told me
that only one of us was going to make it.
And that they were
going to let our friends choose.
Okay, Rachel. It's going to be fine. It going
to be all right. They're coming for you.
Okay. I'll help you. Talk me through
with what's going on with you.
Can find anything sharp?
I'm trying.
What...Harvey?
Harvey, what's happening?
All available units.
Converge to 250 52nd street.
Do you want to know
why I use a knife?
Guns are too quick. You can't
savor all the little emotion.
You see... In their last moments
people show you who they really are.
So, in a way I know your
friends better than you ever did.
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?
-- What's that?
-- He's got some kind of a contusion.
I know you're going to enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.
Easy! Easy!
Drop the weapon now! Let him go now!
Drop the weapon!
-- Sorry.
-- What do you want?
I just want my phone call.
What ... What's happening?
Just talk to me
for one second.
Alright.
Is that a ... phone?
Mount the curb!
Harvey ... just in case,
I want to tell you something.
Don't think like that, Rachel!
They're coming for you.
I know they are.
But I don't want them to.
I don't want to live without you and
I do have an answer for you.
My answer is yes.
No! No! No! Not me. Why
are you coming for me? No!
Rachel! Rachel!
Harvey ... Okay.
Harvey, it's okay. It's alright.
Listen. Some ...
No!
Rachel! No!
Hello there.
Back at the MCU
the Joker's gone.
With Lau?
The Joker planned to be caught.
He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
Dear Bruce.
I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
I love him and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him.
When I told you that if
Gotham not longer needed
Batman we could be
together, I meant it.
But now I'm sure the day won't come when
you no longer need Batman.
I hope it does. And if it does,
I'll be there. But as your friend.
I'm sorry, Harvey.
I'm sorry I let you down.
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.
Love, now and always,
Rachel.
I prepared a little breakfast.
Very well, then ...
Alfred.
Yes, master Wayne.
Should I bring this on her?
I was meant to inspire good.
Not madness, not death.
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.
Didn't you think there might be some casualties? Things
are always going to get worse before they get better.
But Rachel, Alfred ...
Rachel believed in what you
stood for. What we stand for.
Gotham needs you.
No. Gotham needs
its true hero.
And I let that murdering psychopathic
blow him half to hell.
Which is why for now they're
going to have to make do with you.
She was going to wait for me, Alfred.
Dent doesn't know.
He can never know.
-- What's that?
-- It could wait.
That bandit in the forest,
in Burma. Did you catch him?
Yes
How?
We burned the forest down.
He's a credible source.
An MNA lawyer from a prestigious consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right thing.
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.
We'll be live at 5 with the
true identity of the Batman.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but you won't accept medication.
That you're refusing
to accept skin grafts.
You remember that name you all had for
me when I was at Internal Affairs?
What was it, Gordon?
Harvey ...
Say it.
Say it!
Two Face ... Harvey Two Face.
Why should I hide who I am?
I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry.
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
Harvey, I need to know which
of my men I can trust.
Why would you listen to me now?
I'm sorry, Harvey.
No, no, you're not.
Not yet.
He's crazy. It's too much...
You should have thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.
You want him?
I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.
You're not so crazy as you look.
I told you I'm a man of my word.
Where's the Italian?
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.
Joker,
What do you do with all your money?
I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy
dynamite, gunpowder and gasoline!
But what ...?
And you know the thing that they
have in common? They're cheap.
I want to know how much they're
paying you to say who Batman really is.
This is our chance. I want
Lau alive. The Joker ... either way.
Hey, Jim! Get a load of this.
Let's take the next caller.
Harvey Dent didn't want to give in to this
maniac. Do you think you know better than him?
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today he may feel differently. And. ..
We wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him now.
You said you were a man of your word.
Oh, I am! I'm only
burning my half.
All you care about is money.
This town deserves a
better class of criminals.
and I'm gonna give it to them.
Tell your men
they work for me now.
This is my city.
They won't work
for a freak.
A freak? Why don't we cut
you up into little pieces
and feed you to your pooches? Hmm?
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message: Everything burns.
-- Who is this?
-- I had a vision.
A world without Batman.
The mob ground out a little profit.
The police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.
And it was so ... boring.
I've had a change of heart.
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything.
But why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in
I want you to call in every officer.
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital.
And start evac and search.
Call the transport authority,
school board, prisons.
Get every available bystander
to a hospital.
The priority is Gotham general.
Wheel everyone out of that place now!
You, you and you. Come with me.
Where are we going, Sir?
To get Reese.
I need you plugged in checking
Gordon's men and their families.
Looking for ... ?
Hospital admissions.
Will you be wanting the Batpod, Sir?
In the middle of the day, Alfred?
Not very subtle.
The Lamborghini then?
Much more subtle ...
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me.
Sir, could you help, please?
Go find a bus for him.
Sir, commissioner. Do you really think an
ordinary citizen will try to kill this man?
See Brian Richards.
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.
-- They're trying to kill me.
-- Maybe the Batman can save you.
Davis, I got space.
Bring him out.
Davis!
I saw Burns and there's Zachary.
Nothing on them.
And a patrolman I don't know.
So what now ...
Where are we going?
Send the information to Gordon.
Get out of here.
Davis!
Ma'am, we're going to
have to move him now ...
It's Berg, isn't it?
Yes, Commissioner ...
You okay, son?
Hi ..
You know ...
I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.
When you and uh ..
Rachel!
... Rachel were being abducted I was
sitting in Gordon's cage.
I didn't rig those charges.
Your men, your plan.
Do I really look like a
guy with a plan?
You know what I am? I'm a dog
chasing cars.
I wouldn't know what to do
with one if I caught it!
You know, I just do things.
The mob has plans,
the cops have plans.
Gordon's got plans.
They're schemers.
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.
I'm not a schemer. I try to show
the schemers how pathetic
their attempts to control
things really are.
So ... When I say ...
Come here.
When I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal ...
You know that I'm telling the truth.
I'm going to need your weapon.
What?
Why? Because my
wife is in the hospital?
Yeah. That would be why.
It's the schemers that
put you where you are.
You were a schemer. You had
plans. And look where that got you.
The police force are taking every
possible precaution
urging everyone not to take matters
into their own hands.
I just did what I do best. I took your
little plan and I turned it on itself.
Look what I did to
this city with a few
drums of gas
and a couple of bullets.
You know ... You know what I noticed?
Nobody panics when things
go according to plan.
Even if the plan is horrifying.
If tomorrow I tell the press that
like a gangbanger will get shot
or a truckload of soldiers will be
blown up, nobody panics.
Because it's all part of the plan.
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die ...
Well then everybody loses their minds!
Introduce a little anarchy.
Upset the established order.
And everything becomes chaos.
I'm an agent of chaos.
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?
It's fair.
You live ...
You die ...
Now we're talking!
Mr. Reese ...
It's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
That was a very brave thing you did.
Trying to catch the light?
You weren't protecting the Van?
Why? Who's in it?
Do you think I should
go to the hospital?
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?
Southeast ... That's Gotham general.
Did you clear the building?
We must know how many were inside!
You got patient lists, role calls.
Right now, we're showing
fifty people missing. One bus.
All these others buses are heading off
to other hospitals. My guess is we missed one.
Yeah? Well, what's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?
Keep looking.
And keep it to yourself.
Now if anybody asks, we got him out.
Get the mayor's office on the line.
We're going to need the national guard.
Fifty people are missing,
including GCN's own Michael Engel.
I'm now being told that we're
cutting to a video GCN has just received.
I'm Michael Engel for Gotham Tonight. What
does it take to make you people want to join in?
You failed to kill the lawyer. I've got to
get you off the bench and into the game.
Come night fall this city is mine. And
anyone left here plays by my rules.
Mr. Fox, security is showing a
break-in at the RND department.
If you don't want to be
in the game. Get out now.
But the bridge and tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise. HA HA! HA HA!
Sweet Jesus!
Shouldn't you be out there?
Doing something?
It is my day off.
I got to take a leak.
Keep an eye out for me.
Now what? You need
someone to shake it for you?
Hello
Dent?
Jesus ... I thought
you was dead.
Half.
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
Must have been Maroni's men.
Shut up!
Are you telling me that you're going to
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
I don't know! He never told me.
Listen, Dent. I swear to God I didn't know
what they were going to do with you.
That's funny.
Because I don't know what's
going to happen to you either.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Beautiful, unethical, dangerous.
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.
And a high-frequency generator receiver.
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.
With half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of Gotham.
This is wrong.
I've got to find this man, Lucius.
At what cost?
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one person.
This is too much power for one person.
That's why I
gave it to you.
Only you can use it.
Spying on 30 million people isn't
part of my job description.
This is an audio signal.
It feeds off within range of any phone
the city you can triangulate its position.
I'll help you this one time.
But consider this my resignation.
As long as this machine is at
Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.
When you finish,
type in your name.
My office is looking over every
inch of the tunnels and bridges,
but with the Joker's threat
there are limited options.
And land routes east?
Backed up for hours.
We'll just release the ferries.
With thirty thousand ready to board.
Plus I want to use the ferries so I can
get some of those prisoners off the island.
The men you and Dent put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.
You should be. Whatever
the Joker's planning
it's a good bet that Harvey's
prisoners might be involved.
I want to get them out of here.
So where is Harvey?
We haven't found him.
Jesus ...
How long can you keep this quiet?
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing!
Going to join your wife?
You love her?
Yes
You ever imagine what it would
be like to listen to her die?
Look take it up with the Joker. He killed
your woman. He made you ... like this.
The Joker's just a mad dog.
I want whoever let
him off the leash.
I took care of Wuertz. Who is your
other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel? It must have
been someone she trusted.
Look, if I tell you
you'll let me go?
Can't hurt your chances.
It was Ramirez.
But you said ...
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
You're a lucky man.
But he's not.
Who?
Your driver.
Hey, man! We should
be on that boat!
You want to ride a bus with them?
Be my guest.
Sir, they've stopped their engines.
Right. Get on the radio.
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scum bags.
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.
What the heck was that?
Liberty, come in please. This is Spirit.
We have the same problem.
We lost both engines.
Fox. There's something going on
on the ferries.
Get down to the engine room now
Captain, we got a hundreds barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.
-- Oh my God!
-- Looks like some kind of detonator.
Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?
Tonight you are all going to
be part of a social experiment.
For the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate,
I am ready right now
to blow you all sky high.
Liberty, come in. Over.
It's dead.
Anyone attempts to get
off their boat, you all die.
I'm zeroing in.
Each of you has a remote
to blow off the other boat.
The voice is on the ferry.
But it's not the source.
West!
-- Gordon.
-- I have the Joker's location.
Prewitt Building.
Put some along
the building offices.
At midnight I blow you all up.
If however one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live.
So whose it going to be? Harvey Dent's
most-wanted scum bag collection?
Or the sweet and innocent civilians?
You choose.
Oh! And you might want
to decide quickly because...
the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.
Stay back!
Well who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over at least.
We don't have to die.
Those men had their chance.
We are not going to talk about this.
Why aren't we talking about it?
They're talking over the
same exact thing on the other boat.
Let's put it to a vote.
Hello?
Barbara. It's Anna Ramirez.
Jim needs you to pack up and
put the kids in the car right away.
But the unit's outside?
Those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.
I'll call them off for ten minutes.
And you'll have to move fast.
Where am I supposed to take them?
Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
Okay.
Did she believe you?
That's because she trusts you.
Just like Rachel did.
I didn't know ...
Didn't know what they were going to do?
You're the second cop
to say that to me.
What exactly did you
think they were going to do?
They got me early on. My mother's
hospital bills ...
Don't!
I'm sorry ...
You live to fight
another day, office.
We found the missing hospital bus.
And we have a hostage situation.
It's a shooting gallery. Why would he
choose a spot with such good windows?
We have clear shots on five clowns. The
snipers take them out, smash the windows,
A team repels in,
a team moves in by the stairwells.
Two, three casualties max.
Let's do it.
It's not that simple.
With the Joker it never is.
What's simple is that every second we don't take in those
people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up
That won't happen.
Then he'll blow both of them up!
We don't have time for paper.
I want everybody to put their
votes on this piece of paper.
If anyone's got a pen pass it along.
We need to get the votes in quickly.
I need five minutes alone.
No! There's no time!
We have clear shots! Dent is in there
with them. We have to save Dent.
I have to save Dent!
Two minutes. Then we rush.
Fox, I need picture.
-- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble!
Okay. We got POV on alpha.
Unveiling beta.
It looks like clowns and hostages on 2 floors.
A SWAT team on stairwell.
Another SWAT team on the roof.
Barbara, calm down!
He has the kids!
Hello Jim.
Harvey, where's my family?
Where my family died.
Blue Team, acquire the target.
Fox, the SWAT's targeting the wrong people!
The clowns are the hostages!
Red Team go!
Don't move.
Take the shot!
Those SWATs are coming in hard.
Clown, put down your gun!
Doctors get down, clear the line of fire!
Freeze!
You see those bad
guys on the floor above?
They're waiting for help with the
SWAT team coming up the elevator.
The tally is 140 against,
So go ahead, do it!
We're still here.
That means, they haven't
killed us either.
Trouble on the floor above.
Freeze!
Or we will shot!
We got him, he's out of the game.
Step away from the edge!
Don't move!
Ah, you made it!
I'm so thrilled.
Where's the detonator?
-- Go get him!
You don't want to die,
but you don't know how to take a life.
Give it to me. That man
will kill you and take it anyway.
Noone wants to get their hands dirty.
Fine, I'll do it.
Those men on that boat. They made
their choices. They chose to murder and steal.
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.
Oh the old familiar places!
Hostages are safe.
Give it to me.
You can tell I took it by force.
Give it to me and I'll do what
you should have did 10 minutes ago.
We really should stop this fighting.
Otherwise, we'll miss the fireworks!
-- There won't be any fireworks.
-- And herewego!
What were you trying to prove?
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you are?
You're alone!
You can't rely on anyone these days,
you got to do everything yourself, don't we?
That's okay. I came prepared.
It's a funny world that we live in
speaking of which,
you know how I got these scars?
No, but I know
how you got these!
Ugh, you. You just
couldn't let me go, could you?
This is what happens when an unstoppable
force meets an immovable object.
Youtruly areincorruptible,
aren't you, huh?
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of self-righteousness.
And I won't kill you
because you're just too much fun!
I think you and I
are destined to do this forever.
You'll be in a
padded cell forever.
Maybe we could share one!
You know, they'll be doubling up the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
This city just showed you that it's
full of people ready to believe in good.
Until their spirit breaks completely!
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent
and all the heroic things he's done.
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul
in a fist fight with you?
No. You need an ace
in the hole. Mine's Harvey.
What did you do?
I took Gotham's "White Knight" and I
brought him down to our level.
It wasn't hard. You see, madness,
as you know, is like gravity.
All it takes is a little push!
This is where they brought her, Gordon
after your men handed her over.
This is where she died.
I know, I was here,
trying to save her.
But you didn't!
-- I couldn't!
-- Yes, you could have. If you had listened to me
if you stood up against corruption
instead of doing your deal with the devil!
I was trying to fight the mob!
You wouldnt dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I lost.
Have you ever had to talk
to the person you love most
To tell them it's going to be alright,
when you know that it's not?
Well, you're about to know
what it feels like, Gordon.
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.
-- You're not going to hurt my family.
-- No, just the person you love most.
So, is it your wife?
Put the gun down Dent!
Harvey, put down the gun.
Please. Please Harvey. Please.
Goddamn it, will you
stop pointing the gun at my family?!
We have a winner.
-- No, Jim, stop him!
-- Harvey!
Harvey
I'm sorry!
For everything!
Please, don't hurt my son.
You brought your cops?!
All they know is this is a situation.
They don't know who or what,
they're just creating a perimeter.
You think I want to escape from this?!
There is no escape from this!
You don't want to hurt the boy, Harvey.
It's not about what I want!
It's about what's fair!
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time!
But you were wrong.
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world is chance
unbiased, unprejudiced, fair.
His son's got the same chance she had
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act. We three.
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?!
It wasn't.
The Joker chose me!
Because you were the best of us.
He wanted to prove that even
someone as good as you could fall.
And he was right.
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.
So point it at the people responsible.
Fair enough.
You first.
My turn.
Harvey, you're right.
Rachel's death was my fault.
Tell your boy it's going to be alright,
Gordon.
Lielike I lied.
It's going to be alright, son.
Daddy! Dad, is he okay?
Thank you
You don't have to thank me.
Yes I do.
The Joker won.
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for, undone.
Every chance we had at fixing our city
dies with Harvey's reputation.
We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best
of us and tore it down.
People will lose hope.
They won't.
They must never know what he did.
Five dead, two of them cops.
You can't sweep that up.
But the Joker cannot win.
Gotham needs its true hero.
-- No.
-- You either die a hero
or you live long enough to
see yourself become the villain.
I can do those things because
I'm not a hero, unlike Dent.
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.
No, No! You can't,
you're not!
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
Call it in.
A hero. Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.
Nothing less than a knight... shining.
-- They'll hunt you.
-- You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me
set the dogs on me.
Because that's what needs to happen.
Because sometimes the
truth isn't good enough.
Sometimes people deserve more.
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.
Batman!
Batman!
Why is he running, Dad?
Because we have to chase him.
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!
He didn't do anything wrong.
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now
so we'll hunt him
because he can take it
because he's not a hero
he's a silent guardian,
a watchful protector
a Dark Knight.
cy :)

Black.
All important movies start
with a black screen.
And music.
Edgy, scary music
that would make
a parent or studio executive nervous.
And logos.
Really long and dramatic logos.
Warner Bros.
Why not "Warner Brothers"? I don't know.
DC.
The house that Batman built.
Yeah, what, Superman?
Come at me, bro.
I'm your Kryptonite.
Hmm.
Not sure what RatPac does,
but that logo is macho.
I dig it.
Okay.
Get yourself ready for some
reading.
"If you want to make the world
a better place"
"take a look at yourself
and make a change."
"Hooo."
No. I said that.
Batman is very wise.
I also have huge pecs and a nine-pack.
Yeah, I've got an extra ab.
Now, let's start the movie.
Gotham Tower,
this is McGuffin Airlines, Flight 1138.
We are transporting
11 million sticks of dynamite,
17,000 pounds of C-4,
about 150 cute little
classic bomb-type bombs,
and two best friends!
And request permission to fly over
the most crime-ridden city in the world.
Over.
I'm just looking at all the guys' faces
here in the control tower.
- I'm good.
- Sounds good to me.
- Do it!
- Yeah, as long as they're best friends.
- Thumbs up!
- Yep, I think we're cool with that.
Gentlemen,
seal breach in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
What was that?
- One of us should check it out.
- Okay.
Scissors, paper, rock.
- Paper.
- Scissors.
Ha! You always do paper.
I'm a loser at home and a loser at work.
Holy cow!
Captain Dale, is everything okay?
I am afraid Captain Dale had to bail.
I'm your new co-pilot.
And I always come to work
with a smile!
- You should be terrified.
- Why?
Because I will be taking over the city.
Mmm...
- What?
- Batman will stop you.
He always stops you.
No, he doesn't.
What about that time with the two boats?
This is better than the two boats.
- Mmm...
- Well, tonight is gonna be different!
Tonight is my greatest plan yet.
And trust me,
Batman's never gonna see it coming.
Like that time with the parade
and the Prince music?
Hey, quiet!
- Good night, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jeff.
Man, I really like that guy.
I sure hope nothing bad happens to him.
Nothing bad ever happens to me
What the...
Your city is under attack
by Gotham's greatest criminal minds.
Including
The Riddler.
Scarecrow.
Pizza delivery.
- Bane.
- Hello.
Two-Face!
We need that door open, baby!
Catwoman.
Meow, meow. You're in! Meow, meow.
I'm jumping out of the way!
And let's not forget, Clayface.
Poison Ivy.
- Freeze!
- No!
You freeze!
Mr. Freeze!
Penguin, Crazy Quilt, Eraser.
Polka-Dot Man, Mime, Tarantula.
King Tut, Orca, Killer Moth,
March Harriet, Zodiac Master,
Gentleman Ghost.
Clock King, Calendar Man, Kite-Man,
Catman, Zebra-Man, and the Condiment King.
Okay, are you making some of those up?
Nope, they're all real.
Probably worth a Google.
- Hey, watch it!
- Commissioner Gordon!
What is it, O'Hara?
We just got a report!
All the Z-grade villains have
broken into the energy plant!
What are we gonna do, sir?
The only thing we ever do.
Flip the switch to the Bat-Signal!
Flip!
Commissioner, are you there?
The Bat-Signal, she's been egged!
It's Egghead, sir.
I'm well aware of his work.
Dear gosh.
You've destroyed the Bat-Signal.
You have thought of everything.
Yeah, I know!
And when I take over Gotham City...
Opening reactor core doors.
...Batman will grovel at the feet
of his greatest enemy!
Me! The Joker!
Joker, do you read me?
10-4, girl buddy.
We're ready for you, sugar plum.
Well, then, let's raise the roof!
Fire in the hole!
O'Hara, have you tried the Bat-Phone?
Yes, but all I'm getting
is this hold music.
I love it.
- I want snipers trained on that building!
- You bet!
- I want water and air support, yesterday!
- Ahoy, sir!
And I need SWAT here now!
Phone call for Commissioner Gordon.
Hello? Batman?
Hi, Jimmy! It's the Jokes. Oop!
Nobody calls you that.
Yes, people do call me that.
Okay, listen up.
Go, go, go!
At this very moment,
an unnecessarily complicated bomb
is being attached
to the inside of the main energy core.
If the mayor isn't here in five minutes
to negotiate the city's surrender,
then I shall destroy Gotham City.
I did something!
Doctor, that sounds frightening
and overly complicated.
Talk us through it.
Well, I don't wanna scare
any small children who may be listening,
but it's a little-known fact
that Gotham City
is built on a bunch of flimsy plates
stuck together.
There's literally nothing beneath us,
except an infinite abyss
that smells like dirty underwear.
If Joker's bomb were to go off,
these plates would break apart,
plunging every Gotham citizen
into the eternal abyss forever.
And you wouldn't want that, now would you?
Now get me the mayor! Joker out!
Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!
- Jim, did you find Batman?
- No, ma'am.
Then we have no choice.
The Joker has the upper hand.
We have to surrender Gotham City.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry!
Flying the mayor package in right now.
SWAT team, get your stun guns ready!
- Non-lethal.
- Yeah!
Lowering mayor package through hole.
Madam Mayor!
Thanks for dropping by.
I've only got one thing
to say to you, Joker.
Well, you better make it fast.
Do you like to gamble?
Oh, I certainly do.
Do you ever play roulette?
On occasion.
Well, let me give you a word of advice.
I'm all ears.
When playing roulette...
Yes?
...always bet on black.
Batman?
What are you doing?
You're completely outnumbered here!
Are you nuts?
You wanna get nuts? Come on!
Let's get nuts!
'Cause I just wrote a song
about how I'm gonna kick all your butts!
Stop him before he starts singing!
Yeah!
In the darkest night
I make the bad guys fall
There's a million heroes
Computer, overcompensate.
But I'm the best of them all
I'm on my way, sir.
- Who has the coolest gadgets?
- Batman!
- Who has the tricked-out ride?
- Batman!
- Who does the sickest backflips?
- Batman!
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Batman!
Yeah, hey, hey! Batman jam!
Da-Na, da-Na, da-Na, da-Na
Batman!
You think my muscles are big?
Thank you.
You haven't seen my brain
Ladies, it's okay if you stare
Why?
'Cause I'm a billionaire
Get it together, guys!
You're making me look bad
in front of Batman!
'Puter, where's the bomb?
The bomb is located
at the base of the energy core.
What the...
I get the last laugh, I get the final grin
Throw you into the asylum
With Harley Quinn
Turn Two-Face
To black-and-blue face
I 100% am not Bruce Wayne!
Kiss me, Batman.
- Who's the manliest man?
- Ugh!
Batman!
- With the buns of steel?
- Batman!
'Puter.
- Who could choke-hold a bear?
- Batman!
- Who never skips leg day?
- Batman!
Who always pays their taxes?
Not Batman
How is he beating all of you again?
Because...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I'm Batman!
It's gonna blow!
I'm Batman!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I'm Batman!
Hi, Batman!
So weird to keep running into you.
Batman!
Looks like your plan failed.
Well, it's only a matter of time
before I take over Gotham City.
When has that ever happened? Computer!
Calculating. Never.
You know why?
Because I'm always one step ahead of you.
And I always get away!
Not this time.
'Cause this time
I got you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's only one problem.
Who's gonna defuse the bomb?
It's gotta be one or the other, Batman.
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.
You can't do both.
I'm sorry, what did you just say?
You can't do both, I said.
No, I mean the other thing.
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.
You think you're my greatest enemy?
Yes! You're obsessed with me!
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are! Who else drives you
to one-up them the way that I do?
- Bane.
- No, he doesn't!
- Superman.
- Superman's not a bad guy!
Then I'd say that I don't
currently have a bad guy.
I am fighting a few different people.
What?
I like to fight around.
Okay, look, I'm fine with you
fighting other people
if you wanna do that,
but what we have is special.
So, when people ask you
"Who's your number one bad guy?"
you say...
Superman.
Are you seriously saying
that there is nothing,
nothing special about our relationship?
Whoa.
Let me tell you something, J-bird.
- Batman doesn't do 'ships.
- What?
As in "relationships."
There is no "us."
Batman and Joker are not a thing.
I don't need you.
I don't need anyone.
You mean nothing to me.
No one does.
Hurray! Batman!
You did it!
You're welcome.
- Thank you, Batman.
- Oh, my pleasure.
Batman, we love you!
Thank you!
I'm blushing super hard under the mask.
- Grazie, Batman!
- Prego.
- You're the best, Batman!
- Oh, I'm humble.
- Thanks, Batman!
- I'm super modest about it. Thank you.
- Batman, you're the greatest!
- Oh, pray hands, pray hands.
- Thanks for saving the city!
- You're welcome.
Batman, I love you more than my kids!
So do I, guy!
You're our hero, Batman!
I love my life.
Computer.
Go ahead.
- Are we near the orphanage?
- Yes.
Great.
Let's turn those frowns upside down.
That sounds like the Batmobile.
No way!
Hey, orphans! Look who's here!
It's Batman!
Hey, kids.
Who wants a shot from the merch gun?
- I do, I do, I do!
- Great!
- Kaboom!
- I got a lunchbox!
- Kaboom!
- I got a sippy cup!
- Kaboom!
- I got a Batarang!
And the rest of you get Bat Bucks.
Kaboom!
Remember, kids,
if you want to be like Batman,
take care of your abs. Batman out!
Batman! Batman! Batman!
Thanks, Batman. You're my hero!
Whoo!
What is the password?
Iron Man sucks.
Thank you.
It must be great to be Batman.
I can only imagine
he is going home right now
to party the night away,
surrounded by scores of friends
and lady tennis players.
Hey, Computer.
I'm home.
Welcome home, sir.
Initializing Batcave operating system.
Hey, 'Puter.
What's up, Batman?
Put this bomb in the museum.
Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
Anything exciting happen when I was gone?
You have four pieces of mail.
Great, what'd I get?
You have this week's Pennysaver,
two bills,
and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond.
It expires in two weeks.
But I've heard that some stores
will honor them past the expiry date.
Copy that.
Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor,
grouting tiles in the second bathroom
of the fifth master bedroom.
Do you want me to tell Alfred you're home?
No, that's cool, Computer.
Thanks for the update.
I should probably have some dinner.
Alfred left your lobster thermidor
in the fridge.
Oh, that's my favorite.
I can't wait.
Oh, not 20 minutes. Stupid.
Oh, wait.
There, which one is, uh...
Okay.
You complete me.
Shut up. You had me at hello.
Love it!
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
I, uh...
I saved the city again today.
I wish you could have seen me.
I think you would have been really proud.
There you are!
Oh! Alfred! I am so sorry.
I have incredible reflexes.
No, it's all my fault, sir.
I should have known better
than to sneak up on you like that.
Sorry, I was just lost in thought,
and as you know,
when I'm in there, I'm in deep.
Were you looking
at the old family pictures again?
At the what? The old family...
Oh, yes! I see what you mean.
Look at that! The old gang.
Yeah. No, I wasn't.
I see.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying,
I'm a little concerned.
I've seen you go through similar phases
in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005
and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989
and that weird one in 1966.
Do you want to talk about
how you're feeling right now?
I don't talk about feelings, Alfred.
I don't have any, I've never seen one.
I'm a night-stalking,
crime-fighting vigilante,
and a heavy metal rapping machine.
I don't feel anything emotionally,
except for rage.
24/7, 365, at a million percent.
And if you think that there's something
behind that, then you're crazy.
Good night, Alfred.
Sir, it's morning.
Master Bruce, you live on an island,
figuratively and literally.
Yeah. I love it.
You can't spend
the rest of your life alone,
dressed in black,
listening to angry music,
and staying up all night.
Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.
But don't you think it's time
you finally faced your greatest fear?
- Snakes?
- No.
- Clowns?
- No.
Snake clowns?
Bruce, listen.
Your greatest fear is
being a part of a family again.
Nope. Now it's snake clowns,
because you put that idea in my head.
- Sir?
- Time for push-ups!
One, two... We're going to 1,000.
I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.
It is possible. I'm already at 20.
You're scheduled to go to
Jim Gordon's retirement party.
What? No. I don't wanna do that.
- You're going to have a great time!
- No, no, no.
You might meet some new people!
No, no, no!
You could even make some new friends.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No!
And before you go,
we can do your favorite thing.
Tuxedo dress-up party.
Sir, aren't you forgetting something?
- Nope.
- Your cowl.
My what, now?
Your armored face disguise?
Fine.
- Happy now?
- Indubitably.
Good. Must be nice to be happy.
Tonight, on Metropolis in Focus,
we have our favorite star, Superman!
What up, Gotham!
Superman, tell me. How do you feel
about your recent banishment
of Zod to the Phantom Zone?
Yeah, look, Pippa, it's...
It's complicated. Okay?
Zod and I, we've had some
pretty epic battles over the years.
I don't believe I would be Superman
without fighting Zod.
See? Superman gets it. Why can't Batman?
Check it out, guys.
I built a CD rack. Ta-da!
And how am I supposed to get
Batman's respect
when I'm working with these human farts?
Boo-boo, look at me.
You're too good for Batman.
He needs to open his eyes
and see what it feels like
when you're not around. Okay?
Yeah, Pippa. I couldn't put Zod
in a regular prison, right?
He's Zod. Come on!
No, he needed to go someplace
where he could never harm
Metropolis ever again.
The Phantom Zone.
Ah, yes, the notorious space jail
that houses the greatest
super-villains of all time.
They've got, like,
the sickest baddies up there.
They got, like, this guy.
- And her.
- I'll get you, my pretty!
- To say nothing about him.
- Wingardium Leviosa!
And these guys.
Exterminate!
I'm starting to get an idea, monkey face.
Bruce, over here!
Okay, shutterbugs. Look alive, here we go.
I'm gonna give you three poses. You ready?
Kissy face.
Oops, I did it again.
And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?
I'm out of here, guys. Thank you.
- Congresswoman.
- Mr. Wayne, good to see you.
- Senator, looking great.
- Bruce.
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Bruce, any advice
for the new commissioner?
Long as he knows how to push the button
for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.
Bruce, I don't know how you did it.
You can't prove it, you didn't do it.
Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!
Come and join us!
Mr. Prime Minister.
Did you have some work done?
No way!
Bruce Wayne!
He's the greatest orphan of all time.
Shamon, Shamon
- Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador.
- Mr. Wayne!
- You want a picture?
- That would be swell!
Here we go. Party face!
Boom. Keep it.
Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Wayne.
Call me Bruce, champ.
I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir.
I'm sorry, did you say "jazzed"?
Yes! My name's Richard Grayson, but all
the kids at the orphanage call me Dick.
- Well, children can be cruel.
- Yeah.
- Great to see you, Bruce.
- Nice to see you, sir.
- So, I had a question for you, sir.
- Okay, hit me with it.
Do you have any advice
on how to get adopted?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, you do?
- Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph?
- Sure.
Um, all right, for example,
is teeth whitener a good idea?
- Yes. There you go, pal.
- Thanks!
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
- Looking good, Bruce.
- Thank you so much.
How about eyeliner or a foreign language?
- Try both.
- Bueno.
Look, it's the new commissioner!
- Where? Oh, she's with the mayor!
- Okay. Let's see.
Here she is, everyone!
- Oh, my darling!
- Hi, Dad.
Mr. Wayne?
Should I get experimental surgery
to make my eyes larger
and more vulnerable-looking?
Uh, do that.
Uh, Mr. Wayne?
Are you currently in the market
to adopt a child?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.
Are you looking for more
of a base model orphan
- or one that has more upgraded features?
- Yep.
Like cooking or driftwood art?
- Gymnastic abilities?
- Yep. Yep.
Close-up street magic la David Blaine?
- All of it sounds great.
- Really?
Because all of it sounds like me.
Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be
interested in adopting me
as your future orphan son?
Definitely.
Oh, this is great!
Because all I want is to get adopted,
so I can finally stop being
alone.
We've gathered here tonight to
mark the retirement of Jim Gordon.
Goodbye.
And we wish him well
on his South African jungle safari!
Thank you.
Now, to introduce you
to his exciting new replacement.
Everyone, meet your new commissioner!
Meet Barbara Gordon!
- The new commissioner of Gotham City!
- Whoa!
She was top of her class
at Harvard for Police.
She cleaned up the streets
of Gotham's nearby sister city Bldhaven
using statistics
and compassion.
And now she's bringing her new ideas
and her nunchucks to Gotham City.
Congratulations, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Here she is, everyone!
Thank you! Thanks!
Hurray!
Ms. Gordon, over here!
- Big smile!
- Wow.
Thank you for the oversized key
to Arkham Asylum.
And, uh, what's this?
Thank you for the switch
to the Bat-Signal.
Nice.
Dad, you've always done a great job
protecting Gotham City.
Flip! That's me.
Thank you. Along with Batman, of course.
Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!
Who I wish was here right now.
Oh, I'm sure he's listening.
I'd like to ask all of you a question.
Are you fed up with crime?
- Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.
- Yeah, we're sick of it.
Great. Then let's talk about
real improvements
that will end the cycle of crime.
I've got a four-point pilot program
that I'd love to share with you.
I wanna hear all four points.
- It's called...
- I am ready.
It takes a village...
Best opening to a title ever.
Not a Batman.
- Waiter.
- Sir?
- Can I?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Thanks so much.
- What?
- Look.
Batman's been on the job
for a very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very long time.
He has aged phenomenally.
However, despite all the great work
Batman has done for us,
Gotham City is still the most
crime-ridden city in the world.
- She's got a great point.
- Interesting.
Historically speaking, that is accurate.
- He hasn't captured Riddler.
- You know, she's right.
He hasn't captured Bane.
- Huh!
- Or Catwoman.
Or Two-Face,
or any of Gotham's other villains!
He's not good at his job.
Including the Joker!
She's making a lot of sense.
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
We love you, Barbara!
- Yes.
- Hi. Bruce Wayne.
Billionaire, bon vivant,
gallivanter, playboy,
Gotham's most eligible bachelor,
like, 90 years in a row.
- That's me right there.
- I know who you are, Mr. Wayne.
You bet you do. Quick quest,
what is your problem with Batman,
and also, what the heck, dude?
I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne.
I'm not a Batman hater.
But we don't need
an unsupervised adult man
karate-chopping poor people
in a Halloween costume.
We need to take
what's good about Batman...
...and marry it to actual laws
and proper ethics
and accountability.
I hate everything you just said.
Because my dream is for the police force
to team up with Batman.
Waiter.
Wouldn't that be better?
And I know that, together,
the world's greatest detective...
...and Gotham's finest
could clean up these crime-ridden streets.
Forever.
Everybody, get down!
Grand entrance!
Everyone! Make your way
to the exits immediately!
Run!
Team Bane, block the exits.
Going somewhere?
Clayface, Freeze, bring me
the new Commissioner Gordon.
- We're on it.
- Cool.
And, Harley, you know what to do.
I sure do.
It's time for Operation
"Take Out the Laundry."
Butler One, this is Bat One. Do you copy?
- Go ahead, Bat One.
- I need my armored face disguise, now!
Only if you say the magic word.
- Now!
- No.
- You're fired.
- No. Sir, we'll talk about this
back at the Batcave.
- Hey, 'Puter.
- Yes?
Initialize masterbuild music.
Right away.
Collateral damage assessment
suggests the Scuttler, sir.
Good plan.
Madam Mayor, stay close to me.
Head for the south exit.
Now, ma'am.
Go! Go! Go!
Honey, let Batman take care of it.
Dad, I got this.
Scuttler online.
Chief O'Hara, we're coming in hot!
I'm almost there.
Chief, get the mayor to safety.
Computer, I've got the Joker in my sights.
Team, I got the Joker in my sights.
Joker!
Joker.
Uh, excuse me? I was about to...
Push the Bat-Signal? Good call.
I like your instincts.
I've got a surprise for you guys.
And it's gonna make you smile.
Uh-oh! His smile is our grimace.
Everybody, get down.
- I...
- Joker, no!
...surrender.
What?
Uh, what did you just say?
I said, "I surrender."
Joker, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, my Bat-ears
must be malfunctioning
because it sounds...
I surrender!
Okay, you know what? Cool it.
You're a criminal.
You run, and I catch you.
Not anymore, Batman.
You were right. There is no "us."
So, there's no point
in me trying to fight you anymore.
Therefore, I will be surrendering myself
to our strong-willed and
forward-thinking new commissioner.
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!
That's really suspicious.
Yeah, it is. What are you up to, Joker?
I just wanna go to Arkham
and pay for all of my crimes.
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!
Are you actually saying "blink"?
No! Blink, blink, blink.
Joker! That's enough.
Okay, Babs. I got this.
Not so fast, Batman.
You can't fight me anymore.
I'm off the market.
What are you talking about?
I'm off the menu.
You won't get to fight
any of this anymore.
Man, am I sorry I asked.
Anyway, have fun in jail and...
Batman, what are you doing?
Punching Bane.
That was unnecessary.
Oh, no, you can't fight Bane
anymore either.
Really?
Yeah. Or Riddler.
Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King.
Why not?
Because we're all surrendering.
Right, guys?
We are?
Yes!
Riddle me this. What just happened?
It's the end of crime!
All right!
- That was amazing!
- Over here, over here!
- You did it!
- Yeah, of course I did. I'm...
Sorry, not you.
We're talking to Commissioner Gordon.
- Well, it was a team effort.
- I got this, Babs.
Commissioner, how do you feel?
Amazing! This is a great first day.
Okay.
- Question for Batman.
- Shoot.
What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?
What do you mean, the rest of my life?
We don't need a vigilante crime fighter
now that there's no more crime.
Uh, yes, you do.
You can spend some quality time
with your family.
My...
Okay, Batman. We'll take it from here.
All right, listen up.
All of you have
the right to remain silent.
Let's roll out!
Toodle-oo, Batman!
- Bye, Batman.
- Au revoir, Batman.
Bye, Batman.
Bye, Batman!
Today is a victory
for the citizens of Gotham City!
No more crime!
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!
Is everything okay, sir?
You've barely touched
your lobster thermidor.
I don't have time to eat
lobster thermidor right now!
Warrior two.
Pigeon pose. Tree pose.
Tree pose.
Hey, Batman!
Barbara!
What are you doing?
Nothing. I have a very full life.
No, I mean, what are you doing here?
Surveillance. On the Joker.
Batman, we both know
the Joker's up to something.
Well, then we can't just let him
run around loose in a prison.
He's not loose.
He has to go someplace outside the law.
- Outside the law?
- Yeah.
Somewhere like, uh...
Hi, there. I'm here
from Phantom's Own Laundry.
Here to take that bad stuff
off your hands.
Wait, that's it! The Phantom Zone.
The Phantom Zone? No way!
That is super illegal
and way outside our jurisdiction.
So, why don't you and I work together
inside the law,
to figure out what he's up to?
Batman works alone.
That's my motto. Copyright Batman.
Batman, there are no more vigilantes
allowed in Gotham City.
Okay. Totally got it.
Then I have to go into
double-secret super vigilante mode.
You said that out loud.
I know that she said I said that out loud,
but there's no way I did.
She has no idea what's going on
in my super-mind.
Super-mind?
Smoke bomb!
Computer, how do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?
Quickest route, no freeways.
'Puter, do you hear me?
Hello, Master Bruce.
Alfred, there's something wrong
with the Batcomputer. Watch this.
'Puter. Nothing.
'Puter. Do you see what I'm saying?
There's nothing wrong with it, sir.
I have just taken away
your computer privileges.
The parental lock? You can't do that.
Oh, I can. I've been reading
Setting Limits
for Your Out-of-Control Child.
You know what? Doesn't matter, 'cause
I have a double-secret super password
that unlocks the parental lock.
You mean, "Alfred da Butt-ler,"
with two T's?
Sir, it's time for you
to stop this unhealthy behavior.
No, it's not.
You need to take responsibility
for your life.
Not right now, I don't.
And it starts by raising your son.
I'm sorry.
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.
The young orphan you adopted
at the gala. Remember?
Wow! Stairs. Whee!
He's been living here for the past week.
Hello, table! Boom!
And I must say, I've grown
rather fond of the young lad.
Hello, secret camera.
You should get to know him.
We are family
- You and he have a lot in common.
- En garde.
Hello, family photos.
He lost his parents at a very young age.
I've always wanted one of those.
Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone
to take him under their wing,
as I took you under mine?
Alfred, you've been watching
way too many Lifetime movies
and drinking chardonnay.
- It's Pinot grigio, sir.
- Whatever it is.
Listen, you don't have a family.
You're satisfied serving me.
So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?
Now, I'm gonna go fight crime
while you put that kid on the next jet
to the orphanage. Got it?
As you wish, sir.
Whoops-a-daisy.
Wait, what are you doing?
Dusting.
You can't let him into the Batcave!
I'm not. I'm letting him into your life
via the Batcave.
What?
It's the Batcave!
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Batman! Whoa!
You're darn right, "Whoa."
Wait, does Batman live
in Bruce Wayne's basement?
No. Bruce Wayne lives in Batman's attic.
- We can have sleepovers every night!
- No, we can't.
- Wow! Look, it's the Bat-Sub!
- Wait, don't touch that!
Over there, it's the Bat-Space shuttle.
Please, keep your hands off that.
- Look, it's the Bat-Zeppelin!
- Don't touch that either!
- It's the Bat-Train!
- No!
- It's the Bat-Kayak.
- No!
- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.
- No!
It's the Bat shark repellent?
Uh, actually, you can touch that.
It's completely useless.
Whoa! Thanks, Batman!
Please, stand over there.
And don't touch, look at, or do anything
for the remaining moments
you have in my presence.
Okay, cool.
- Computer.
- Go ahead.
How do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?
Joker can only be put in the Phantom Zone
using the Phantom Zone Projector.
Current location,
Superman's Fortress of Solitude
inside the Atomic Cauldron.
However, only a person that isn't
shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll
can enter the cauldron.
Ugh, I'm way too buff.
You also have beautiful abs, sir.
That's my cross to bear.
Additionally, once inside the cauldron,
multiple Kryptonian
defense systems engage,
including the Acid Moat, Ring of Napalm,
and the Jaws of Death.
Chance of total mission failure is 110%.
Those are not great odds.
Wait a minute.
- Hey, kid.
- Yes, sir?
- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!
- And small?
- Very.
- And quiet?
- When I desire to be.
And 110% expendable?
I don't know what that means, but okay.
Great. Follow me.
We are gonna steal
the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.
- Steal?
- Yeah.
We have to right a wrong.
And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong,
you have to do a wrong-right.
Gandhi said that.
Are we sure Gandhi said that?
- I'm paraphrasing.
- Cool!
Preparing Fortress
of Solitude infiltration gear.
Wow! Look at all these!
Do I get a costume for the mission, too?
I got a feeling that you'll just look
like a kid on Halloween.
Don't you think?
Don't touch that.
Whoo-hoo!
- El Mariachi.
- I like that one!
- That one is culturally insensitive.
- Night Terror.
- That one!
- No way.
- This one?
- Death Merchant.
- No.
- I'm okay.
- This one.
- Fire Starter.
- This one.
- Clawed Reigns.
- Excali-Bat.
- This one?
- Silent but Deadly.
- Nope.
Bat-ryshnikov.
How do we feel about this one?
Dress-up parties are for grown-ups only.
Wait. What's that one there?
That one was for the assignment
called The Jamaican Caper.
The locals called me Reggae Man.
I love it!
Ah! Feels like I was poured into this.
My only trouble is,
these pants are just a little tight.
I don't know if I could throw a kick
or jump in them.
I got an idea. Rip! That's better!
Now I'm free, now I'm moving.
Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!
I can only look you in the eyes right now.
- Sir, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?
Why is Master Dick dressed like that?
How dare you tell me
how to parent my kid I just met?
To the Batmobile!
Hot-diggity-dog!
Vehicle rotisserie engaged.
Retrieving the Speedwagon.
Atomic batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Hey, kid. Let's go.
- Oh, shoot!
- What?
I probably shouldn't leave
until I get the thumbs up
from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.
Uh, yeah. Here's the thing.
Bruno and I decided
to share custody of you.
So I get a say
and you're mission approved.
No way! Is this really happening?
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
A month ago, I had no dads.
Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!
- And one of them is Batman!
- Yeah.
It's raining dads!
So,
are you ready to follow Batman
and maybe learn a few
life lessons along the way?
I sure am, Dad Two!
But first, where's the seatbelt?
The first lesson is,
life doesn't give you seatbelts!
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Faster, Dad! Faster!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
Yes, yes, yes!
Oh! Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry.
Get back up in that seat. There you go.
Hey, listen.
As soon as I get back to the Batcave,
I'll make sure that
Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay?
But for the time being,
I'm just gonna put my arm right here.
And we're just gonna
gently ease out of here.
And here we go.
Okay. Like all superheroes,
Superman has zero friends,
and he spends most of his time
basking in sweet, sweet isolation,
here at his alone palace.
So, I'll keep him busy
while you sneak into that vent
and get the Projector. Got it?
Copy that! Oh, here's an idea.
I could also...
Whoa, whoa.
Don't even finish that thought.
See this counter?
These are all the good ideas Batman has.
And no one else has ever had
any good ideas. So don't even try.
Your super power...
...is excellent listening
and execution of my ideas.
- Let's try it out.
- Cool!
Drop to the ground. Do a backflip.
Do a front flip. Triple Axel.
Pli. Relev. Jet. Pythagorean theorem.
A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
Physicalize it!
A squared plus B squared
equals C squared.
- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.
Yes!
And don't call me "Dad."
Now, begin mission.
Yes, Papa.
"Papa" falls into the "Dad" category.
'Sup, Supes?
Wow. It's Batman.
And he's at my house.
Right now.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry about it, dawg.
I'm not here to throw down or anything.
Uh, no, I would crush you.
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.
Hey, listen. Thank me later,
but I just happened to be in the hood.
And I figured that you could
probably use the...
...company.
Wait a minute.
Are you... Are you having
the "57th Annual Justice
League Anniversary Party"
- without me?
- No.
No! No! No!
No! There must have been
some mistake with the email.
That's crazy, man.
Totally! Yes, email mistakes
happen all the time.
Sometimes I don't get
Superman's emails for
years.
Great point, G.L. Great point.
All right.
Well, that clears up everything, right?
Enjoy the party, bro.
Hit it, DJ Wonder Dog.
I'm Superman at the super party
I'm Superman at the super party
Hey-hey
Hey, Batman.
Do you wanna take a quick pic?
Sure. Where do you want me?
Right there is perfect.
- Here's the camera.
- Oh.
Okay, party people, get together.
Yeah. Everybody say...
Super Friends!
Let me see it! Let me see!
Classic! We got everyone.
Yeah, everyone.
Thanks, Batman.
Yeah, no problem. I did, like, a burst.
This party is the bomb!
Look at me! More like
Martian Dance Hunter, am I right?
'Puter, call kid.
Bat-Dad?
How's it going?
'Cause everything is
going great down here.
I can see the target.
But there's some kind of laser energy
thing that I can't get through.
Okay. I'll see if I can shut it off.
But I'm gonna have to make up an excuse
to leave this party without anyone noticing.
Bye.
Kid, tell me when it's off, all right?
- Now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
- Now?
- Not quite.
- Now?
- No.
- My son...
- No.
These irreplaceable crystals contain all
my knowledge, which I now pass on to...
Darn it. It's gotta be one of these.
Is this the one?
O.M. gosh! You did it, Padre! It's off!
Okay.
Now you gotta make your way
to the Atomic Cauldron
and get that Phantom Zone Projector.
- Do exactly as I say.
- 10-4!
Okay. Jump!
Do a front flip. Do a backflip.
Run, run, run. Drop.
That's excellent listening.
Shimmy.
Strafe-left. Strafe-right.
Avoid.
Hey, I was thinking.
If I'm gonna be a superhero,
and go on awesome superhero missions
like this one, can we use code names?
Mine can be Robin.
- I'm sorry, say that again?
- Robin!
As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?
Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase.
Tweet, tweet, on the street.
- Hard pass.
- And a song.
Fly, Robin, fly
Harder pass. Now slide!
Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you
how to masterbuild your way
inside that thing.
Yay!
Grab those 2x6's, pull out the axle studs,
disconnect the 6x10 plates.
Like this?
Whoa! Unbelievable obeying.
Now, let's ride.
Toes to the nose.
Now you're gleaming the cube.
- Yeah!
- Now, get creative.
Freestyle a little bit.
Oh, that's good, kid!
It's like looking in a Bat-mirror.
Okay. Leap.
- I've got the Projector, Dad.
- Booyah!
Now do everything we just did backwards.
Oh.
Oh! Here you go, Dad. We did it!
Yeah! Mission accomplished. That was fun!
You okay, Batman?
You seem the opposite of stern.
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just
watching you out there,
it was like the world wasn't
all darkness anymore.
For a brief moment
I could have sworn I felt something.
That feeling is pride, sir.
You're right.
I am super proud.
Of myself.
For being such a good teacher, obviously.
Yeah, you're a great teacher.
I am?
Yeah! I wanna be just like you
when I grow up, Padre!
Wait, what did you call me?
I called you Padre.
It's Spanish for "Dad." Sorry.
Well, isn't it also a cool Spanish way
to say "buddy"?
Yeah, I could've been saying it that way.
Then I'll allow it.
Oh, you're such a great padre!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to give you a big old hug.
Thought you were attacking me.
Hey, you up for another
top secret superhero mission
to defeat the Joker?
Oh, I am down to stop that clown.
But I don't wanna make
my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.
Do you think we'll be done
before my bedtime?
Bedtime?
Batman's life lesson number two.
Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.
Yes!
So, what's the vigilante policy
on cookies?
Unlimited!
All right, kid.
We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.
So, lesson number three.
When going stealth,
you gotta hide every part of you,
physically and emotionally.
- Got it?
- Yeah!
Already failed.
Now, what I need you to do
is use the naturally dark areas
of your costume,
and integrate into the dark parts
of this environment.
Okay.
- Can you see me?
- Yes.
- How about now?
- Yes.
- What about now? Now?
- Yes.
Yes. You're a goner, kid.
- Batman?
- Barbara!
Batman? Batman!
Hey, there. Look at you.
- Who's this?
- Hi, police lady.
- Is that your son?
- Yes, I am.
Is that my son... No, that's just weird.
It's weirder if it's not your son.
Right. No, I don't...
I'm not in a relationship or anything.
I could have a kid.
I mean, if I met the right lady,
and if she was just standing
right in front of me,
and we looked at each other and thought,
"Hey, let's do this."
"Let's be together."
- Batman?
- Yes?
I hope you're back because you've decided
to work together
on the Joker case.
Uh...
Yeah. Absolutely!
Great.
Ooh. Arkham Asylum.
- So, before we question the Joker...
- Uh-huh.
...I'm gonna need you to hand
over all your weapons.
I mean, I don't know if I have anything...
Oh!
I just got a couple here. There.
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
Oh. Of course.
What about the utility belt?
Anything in your cape?
Under your cowl?
And your shoes.
There we go.
Uh... This is really uncomfortable.
Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants.
Oops.
- Batman?
- Yes?
Why is your "not son"
trying to smuggle
the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?
What? Hey, kid. What is this?
Batman, give me
the Phantom Zone Projector.
- No.
- Batman!
Give me the Phantom Zone Projector!
Give it to me!
No, no, no! Whoa! Nice.
I studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu
at Harvard for Police.
Oh, yeah? Well, guess who got
a PhD in smoke bombs!
Dr. Batman.
Guards! Get them!
Freeze, Batman!
Hey, kid. This is a training exercise.
These guys are my bros.
- Go ahead and take a couple of them out.
- Cool!
- Hey, Frank.
- You want a piece of Robin?
- Barney! Nice compound fracture!
- How'd you like a punch, Glen?
Code Red!
I need total security lockdown, now!
Om!
'Sup, Joker?
Namaste, Batman.
- Namaste.
- Gross.
Ooh. Briefs man. Me, too.
Cut the baloney.
Kid, guard the door, will ya?
On it! Take that, Alan!
Huh. Looks like you're going to
a lot of trouble for little old me.
I must be your greatest enemy after all.
Right, Batman?
- I see what you're trying to do.
- And what is that?
You're trying to entrap me
into a relationship.
- Really?
- Yeah, and it's not gonna work.
Oh, yes, it is.
Because I'm inside your head.
- No, you're not!
- No, you're not!
I knew you'd say that.
- No, you didn't!
- No, you didn't!
And I knew you'd say that!
See? We aren't so different, I and you.
- It's, "you and I!"
- It's, "you and I!"
- Argh!
- Admit it. I'm your greatest enemy.
You're not my greatest enemy, Joker.
Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone.
Fine, I will.
And prove I'm your greatest enemy.
Batman, don't do this.
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone,
I'll be saving Gotham City,
and that's all that matters to me.
Goodbye, Joker.
Oh, Batman, thank you!
Yes! That's what I call
saving the city again!
Batman, what are you doing?
I'm Batman-ing.
I'm Batman, I'm awesome
I got a nine-pack
Stop it!
Batman, I can't believe you did this.
Hi, police lady.
And even worse,
you've made this kid
into an accessory to your crime.
Sorry, kid.
That's okay, ma'am.
As long as I'm doing a dime
in the big house with my old man,
everything's gonna be A-okay.
Officers, take this Projector
to the evidence room.
- You got it.
- And get this man some pants.
I'm good the way I am.
B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?
You know, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be you, Batman.
I wanted to be as strong
and as fast and as smart as Batman.
But you're not who I thought you were.
Uh... What do you mean?
You can't be a hero
if you only care about yourself.
Barbara, I...
I think you're underestimating
the importance of the Joker
being in the Phantom Zone.
Really, it's kind of a stroke
of genius. All the...
Hey, where are you going?
I just put Joker in the one place
he can't do anyone any harm.
Yeah.
But what if you just gave Joker
exactly what he wanted?
Oh!
Whoa!
Look at this place! Am I being too loud?
- Hi!
- Oh, my gosh!
Sorry. I always do that.
How about a warning next time?
You're so right, and I am so wrong.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.
Yeah, bad guy.
- My name is Phyllis.
- Oh, that was my grandma's name.
Now hold still while I scan you.
Scanning for badness.
Trying to assess whether you are bad.
Ugh! Your whole thing screams "bad guy."
Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person.
But with vulnerabilities.
Who, me? No way.
So, where do you keep
all the other bad people in this place?
They're standing right behind you.
Whoa!
Hi there, guys.
Lovely to meet you all. I'm the...
Oh, fist bump? There we... Handshake?
It doesn't matter. I'm the Joker.
Take a look at the new guy.
Guess they'll just let anybody in here.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm very bad, too.
They just showed a video montage...
- Boring!
- What?
- You're boring.
- He looks delicious.
Let's eat this guy.
Stop with the violence for just a second!
What if I told you
I could get you outta here?
I'm sorry, what'd you just say?
That's right. I'm so bad, I got myself
thrown into this heck-hole on purpose!
I'm listening.
Count me interested.
Look, everyone here knows
what it's like to be hurt
by a hero, don't they?
We've all been taken for granted, right?
- Yeah, bro.
- I'm relating.
Well, that's why I came
to this space prison.
To recruit the universe's greatest...
- We'll do it!
- I'm sorry?
You were going to say something about
recruiting the universe's greatest villains
to conquer a superhero.
- Am I right?
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, we're in!
- Yay!
Really? Because I brought a PowerPoint...
Still boring!
Yeah. Just get on with it.
You want us to humiliate him?
I certainly do. Yes.
You want us to make him
grovel at your feet?
I would like to see that very much!
You want us to smite him?
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want us to make
the rivers of Gotham City
run red with his blood?
Oh, that's...
Oh, no blood? How do you feel about lava?
Yes! Lava.
- Done.
- Yay!
- I can't wait to crush buildings.
- Excuse me. Hello?
Over here. I don't want to be a downer,
but how exactly are we going
to get outta this place?
Oh, leave that to me.
Don't wanna jinx us,
but I'll be a lot happier when
this Phantom Zone Projector
is locked up tight.
Going up, ma'am?
No. You're going down!
Look out! Smash!
I guess you're right. I am going up. Ding!
Here comes the...
Phantom Zone!
Huh?
I'm gonna go start looting.
Hello, Gotham City!
The Clown Prince of Crime
is back!
Commissioner Gordon,
you gotta take a look at this.
What's that?
A monkey and dog are friends.
Not that. That!
And I've come
to finally take over the city.
But in order to do that,
I need to break my friends
out of a giant, scary prison.
- Hey, guys, he means us!
- Yay!
And I ain't talking about
those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!
- Oh!
- Me-ouch.
I'm talking about my new peeps!
And they're just like me.
The greatest villains you'll ever see.
You wanna meet them?
- No.
- Too bad.
He's evil, he's magic,
and it's about to get tragic.
It's Voldemort.
Magic!
You are a fish.
You are a frog.
You are a fish frog.
He's a 9,000-year-old incarnation of evil,
with an eye forjewelry.
Give it up for Sauron!
Good afternoon, Gotham City.
He likes long, violent walks
on historic buildings.
It's King Kong!
Come at me, Gotham!
Commissioner Gordon, these monsters,
they're too powerful.
Can you contain them to downtown?
That's gonna be impossible.
Half the police force are fish!
Sergeant Jackson! Stop floppin' around!
And rounding out the evil all-stars,
Wicked Witch!
Medusa.
And British robots!
Exterminate!
Ask your nerd friends.
Hello? Bad guys?
What a crew, huh?
And they all work for me!
Who's the greatest villain
of them all now, Batman?
Still not you.
Actually, this does look
pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad.
Whee!
Nice destruction all around.
Watch your step!
Good work, guys!
Now, all that's left for me
is to rub it in Batman's bat face.
Hey, Sauron, doesn't your flaming eye
have a unique ability
to peer through time and space?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I need to find Batman.
Where's homeboy's man cave?
Hmm. Give me a second.
Scary noise.
It's beneath Wayne Manor!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a sec.
Are you trying to tell me
that Bruce Wayne is Batman...
...'s roommate?
Uh... Yeah.
Evil army, this way to the Batcave!
Good grief!
Hey, Batman!
Joker's home.
I'm rubbing my butt all over your stuff.
We're going to have to rename this
the Butt-mobile.
Hey, evil army.
I need Batman brought here.
Now go get him!
Joker out!
Uh...
Padre?
Yeah?
Do you ever get scared?
No.
Yeah, that's what I figured,
'cause you're Batman.
Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?
Who?
Bruce Wayne.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bruno told me once
that sometimes the only way
to get out of a down moment
is to start boxing.
And by "boxing," he meant
beatboxing.
Oh!
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na...
Feel it, uh-huh
Dick Grayson on the mic, go
Oh. Um...
Oh, my gosh.
This does make me feel better.
Okay. Shh. Batman solo.
Bat, bat, bat, can I get a bat?
Can I get a bat? Bat...
The Bat-Fax!
Ha! The city needs me. Bang, bang, bang!
Excuse me.
Can you get the commissioner
and show her this?
- Batman.
- Would you stop doing that?
I sent the Bat-Fax.
I hate to say this, but you're right.
The city needs you.
Yes! Let me out.
I'm only going to let you out
on one condition.
- Name it.
- You can't do it by yourself.
Fine. Who am I working with?
SEAL Team Six? Fox Force Five?
Suicide Squad?
No. Me.
Oh, I wanna help, too!
- And I shall join as well.
- Whoa!
Alfred Pennyworth at your service, ma'am.
- How did you...
- Alfred, you gotta let me out of here.
Sir, those creatures out there
are unlike anything we've ever seen.
Speak for yourself.
You don't know everything I've seen.
I haven't told you everything.
And you'll never be able
to defeat them alone.
And it'll be more fun
if we all do it together!
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What are you so afraid of?
The thing I'm most afraid of?
I gotta be honest with you.
It's snake clowns.
Yeah, that's not a thing.
Well then, nothing.
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Okay.
Prove it.
- Oh, I will.
- Good.
Do you know what the B-A- in Batman stands for?
- Not really.
- Best At Teamwork.
Best At Teamwork Man is my full name.
Yay! We're going on a family trip.
This is not a family trip.
I can wear my costume, too.
Well, luckily for us,
you left your costume back at the...
- Rip!
- Oh!
Nope. Under your clothes. That's perfect.
- Rip!
- Alfred, what are you doing?
I miss the '60s.
Hey, can Scarecrow help?
- Yeah!
- He's destroying our city, too!
Permit us to lend you assistance.
Yeah. Why don't we use these guys?
What am I gonna do?
Get a bunch of criminals together
to fight the criminals?
That's a stupid idea.
Okay, guys. Game plan.
Joker's taken the Projector
- to Wayne Manor.
- Wayne Manor.
Right. Thanks, Batman.
- We need that Projector.
- Projector.
Or there's no way
- to blast these monsters...
- Monsters.
- ...back to the Phantom Zone.
- Phantom Zone? Yep.
Batman, I really don't
need you to finish my...
- Sand castles.
- No.
- Sister's homework.
- No.
- Succulent something.
- No.
Um... Everybody?
Batman is in Arkham Asylum.
Get him!
Okay, everyone, grab on to me.
Whoa!
We've gotta take cover!
Whoa!
- Joker has eyes on us.
- Where?
No! I mean,
he literally has a giant eye on us.
I think that thing can see our every move!
Shaka-laka-Iako.
We've got to destroy it,
or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.
Uh... Bat-Dad?
I really think you should see this.
Building survey!
This building's not up to code!
Gotcha.
Is that real lava?
I'm okay.
All right, yeah. It's 100% lava.
- Everyone, start throwing me bricks.
- Right away, sir.
- I need a 4x6. Come on, quick.
- Here you go.
- I need an elbow.
- Elbow.
Ow!
Whoo!
Yes! I did it. Pretty cool, huh?
- Batman?
- Yeah?
Why did you build this thing
with only one seat?
'Cause last I checked,
I only had one butt. What the...
What have you done to Wayne Manor?
Hey, Batman, guess what!
I found out one of your secrets.
- Uh-oh.
- What do we have here, Batman?
It looks like a bunch
of relationship comedies.
- What's that one?
- Must Love Dogs.
Must love crying.
- Marley & Me.
- I love the ending.
Oh! Serendipity?
We have Serendipity? I love that movie!
For a loner, Batman,
you sure like movies about relationships!
Oh! And look what else I found!
All your wonderful toys.
Accio lightning storm!
Uh... Everyone, hold on.
Gremlins, dismantle that plane now!
Ugly monsters on our three.
- Uh... Padre?
- Not now, kid.
Kind of got my hands full.
I've got good tone. Firing.
- Uh... Batman?
- What's up, buddy?
- Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?
- Why?
Uh... Your number two
needs to go number one.
I thought I told you
to go back at the prison.
- I tried, but Bane was in there.
- So?
He had sort of a "get out
of this bathroom now" vibe.
I knew I shouldn't
have given you that water.
Can you hold it in like a big boy?
Engine one down.
Not a big deal.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
- Engine two down.
- It does that sometimes.
We've lost engine three.
Oh. Could live without it.
Engine four!
That I do need to fix.
Good news. Our bathroom problem is solved.
You three wait here
while I go fix the engine.
Don't worry, Batman.
You fix the Batwing, I'll fly.
All good, Babs.
I've got my autopilot on it.
Done.
Autopilot? That's just a rope!
Exactly. All right, guys.
Until I get back, rope's in charge.
Thanks, rope.
All right, let's see.
Yes, the piston brake out here.
Jet engine brake in here and...
Get out of here. No.
Give me... No! Stop it!
Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him.
I'm with you, Grandpa!
Get off my Padre!
Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.
What are you two doing here?
I told you to stay in the cockpit.
You disobeyed me. You're on a timeout.
Batman, you're on a timeout.
What? Alfred, you better
un-timeout me right now!
No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.
Guys, you're all un-timeouted!
We have incoming!
- Sir! Watch out for those...
- What are you doing?
Okay. Everybody, timeout off.
Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.
- Batman, I can help you.
- No. Protect the rope.
The rope is fine!
Save Master Dick!
I'm fine. I'll just do
one of my gymnastics moves to...
No!
Dick...
Gotcha!
Hold on, Alfred. I'm almost there!
No!
Alfred!
No.
No!
Move over, rope.
Hold on!
Gotcha!
Barbara, did you see that?
Batrope saved Alfred.
Sick moves, rope.
I never doubted you, bro.
Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.
Rope! You lied to me!
Wait a minute. You mean, without you,
Alfred would have been
street meat?
Batman, trust us.
We can do this.
- Yeah. I know Gymkata.
- Sorry, what's that?
It's a gymnastics-based martial art.
I can punch those '80s monsters
off the plane.
Uh... Okay.
Multiple bogeys on our six.
Sir, I'll get them off our back.
I was a tail gunner
for the Royal Air Force.
Locked and loaded, sir!
Good. Love that!
I got an idea. We're gonna change course.
I want you to fly straight
into that flaming eyeball.
- What?
- Barbara, trust me.
All right. Let's do this.
We got a giant sea monster, 12 o'clock!
Got it.
- We've got his attention.
- He's tracking us.
I've got you now.
Eat dirt!
Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!
Okay, Babs, this is it.
Fly us straight into that eye,
and wait for my signal.
Can it come now?
Can we make the signal thing happen?
Almost there.
Almost there!
- Fire!
- Almost there!
That fire's coming in hot!
Hot, hot, hot!
Now! Barbara, dive bomb!
My eye!
Sauron!
Nothing to see.
Whoo-hoo!
- Yes! That was so rad!
- We did it, everyone!
That was so great! Go team!
Come on, let's hear it for us!
That was incredible!
I felt so jazzed!
I say "jazzed"!
I gotta give it to you, Batman.
That was awesome.
- Ha! And you were awesome.
- Thanks.
- And you were awesome.
- I love compliments!
And you were awesome, and I was amazing.
I'm not trying to make it
about myself, obviously.
But I just wanna make sure
that everyone gets a pat on the back.
- Because it feels good.
- It does feel good.
You had a good idea, you had a good idea,
and you had a good idea,
and I had a great idea.
You know what, I think that collectively,
I'm gonna add...
...one.
- No way!
- Yes!
Man, that feels good.
Best team ever!
Let's take a photo!
All right, everyone, squeeze together.
Hang on a second.
- Nice and close!
- I gotta get my pump on.
- It's worth it.
- Okay, everybody in?
These abs are no fluke.
Everyone say, "Bat Family!"
Bat Family!
Ooh, let's take a look!
Look at that!
- Splendid.
- Wow.
Didn't it turn out great?
Hey, guys! It's my first family photo!
- Hey, Bat-Dad.
- Oh!
Whoa. What are you doing?
I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.
Okay, just...
Batman, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
We are just one big happy
fraternity of people
who did an awesome job together.
I can't think of any other way
to put that.
- Cool.
- So, guys, listen up!
Taking the Projector from the Joker
is gonna be our most
dangerous mission yet.
- A family battle mission!
- Right.
Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler,
and maybe root around,
see if you can find a few Vitamin waters
or something, and then we'll head out.
- Right away, sir.
- Anything for you, Padre.
I think I'll need snowshoes.
Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes,
but could you grab that flashlight?
- Batman?
- Padre?
Sir?
What are you doing? Hey, Batman.
Please, wait!
'Puter.
Yes, sir?
I'm locking in some coordinates now.
Take the Scuttler to the taco stand
on the border of Gotham City
and Bldhaven.
No!
I want you to get these guys
a couple of chimichangas
- and three Jarritos.
- Sir!
And then keep them there until this
whole attack on Gotham City blows over.
Padre, please. Don't do this!
Batman, you need us!
How many times I gotta tell you?
Batman works alone.
No, we have to stick together.
Please.
Now go on, Scuttler. Go!
- Go! Just get outta here.
- Batman.
- Padre!
- Get moving!
Please!
Just go.
Batman! Please, wait!
Scuttler, move out!
You're doing the wrong thing!
- Listen to me! Don't do this!
- Sir, please. Sir!
No!
Scanning for intruders.
Scanning for intruders.
Scanning for intruders.
Hi, Bats.
What have you done to my...
Bruce Wayne's house?
You'd better hope he's a cool guy
and doesn't go crazy.
What happened to all your friends?
I don't need friends.
I don't need anyone to stop you.
Are you sure about that?
Look in the mirror, Batman.
When I saw you working
with your friend-family,
I actually thought you'd changed.
But, no.
You pushed them away.
You've run away from every other person
in your life.
But I'm the one you're always chasing.
Is this about that stupid
"greatest enemy" thing?
No, it's not.
Not anymore.
- You tell him, Joker!
- It's time for a fresh start.
He's not worth it.
I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!
That is right. Respect!
Do you realize that you have never once
said the words,
"I hate you, Joker"?
Not once.
Well, I am starting to feel
pretty annoyed with you right now.
That's for darn sure.
Annoyed is not the same thing!
Listen, Batman.
I...
hate you.
- Aww!
- That's nice.
Now you say it.
Me, too.
You won't. You won't change.
'Cause you can't.
You won't, and you can't.
Batman will never change.
You know what, boo-boo? Just shut it down.
These diseased lunatics are right.
Yes, we are!
I am not gonna be part
of a one-sided relationship any longer!
- Yes!
- What are you talking about?
- You and I are done!
- What is wrong with you?
I'm moving on!
That's ridiculous.
And on my way out,
I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!
No. You're not serious.
Wingardium Leviosa!
No!
You know what?
For once, Batman, you're right.
I'm not your greatest enemy.
Your greatest enemy
is you.
- Goodbye, Batman.
- Wait a minute. Hold on a second.
Good for you, boo-boo!
- Yay!
- Everybody, get a bomb. Let's go.
- Bomb, bomb, bomb. Let's bomb it out.
- Yay!
Say goodbye, Gotham City!
- Whoa.
- Hi!
Whoa!
Oh, I am so sorry.
It was all my fault, I keep doing that.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.
What are you talking about?
I'm not a bad guy.
But you're all in black. You have a cape.
And you wear a big, scary mask.
Well, I'm not.
And you kicked me in the face.
Listen, I'm Batman.
Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.
I swear, I am a good guy.
Okay, Mr. Batman.
Hold still while I scan you.
Scanning for badness.
Yes, sir?
- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!
And 110% expendable?
I don't know what that means, but okay.
- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.
- Yes!
- And don't call me Dad.
Sorry.
Alfred, put that kid
on the next jet to the orphanage.
But doesn't he deserve a chance
for someone to take him under their wing,
as I took you under mine?
Listen, you don't have a family.
So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?
Batman!
We have to stick together.
Please.
Joker, you mean nothing to me.
No one does.
Huh. You're not a traditional bad guy.
But you're not exactly a good guy, either.
- Batman?
- Padre?
You even abandoned your friends.
What?
Go on, Scuttler. Go.
- Batman, no. No!
- Don't do this!
Abandoned? No.
No, I was trying to protect them.
By pushing them away?
Well, yeah.
Are they really
the ones you're protecting?
Computer, Batman's in danger.
Please, Computer, take us back!
Do you really want the man
who made you to come to harm?
Batman programmed me to obey him.
But he didn't say to not not rescue him.
What are they doing?
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.
Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.
Well, hello!
'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode.
- Hold on!
- No!
Evil buddies, those are my last three
painful reminders of Batman.
Run!
Come on, Alfred. This way.
Wait, where's Dick?
The little guy? He's over there.
Initializing Batcave operating system.
What's he doing?
I've gotta save my family!
Just think.
- What would Batman do?
- What?
I know. Not listen to anyone else.
Be mean to people.
Destroy as much property as possible.
Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.
And go it alone.
Kid, don't do that.
Atomic batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Don't do what I would do!
I never even taught you how to drive!
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.
I'm so sorry.
I need to get down there and stop this.
I can't let you go.
My boss will be really mad at me.
Yeah. But I bet your boss would be happy
if you were able to get
all those bad guys back in here.
Hmm. She sure would.
Then let me try.
Let me get down there and help them.
But haven't you tried that before?
This way, Alfred.
You do the same thing over and over.
What's gonna change?
No!
I know what I need to do.
Just give me 24 hours, and I'll come back.
Whoa!
You've gotta let me go
down there and save them.
I'll do whatever you want.
- Please.
- Exterminate!
Please.
Okay, but I need all the bad guys
locked up in here.
I promise.
And I mean all of them.
One of these buttons
has to save my friends.
Self-destruct mode activated.
Self what?
- Master Dick!
- No!
Dick!
Look who's bat!
What?
Everyone okay? Dick, Alfred, Barbara.
- Are you guys...
- We're fine, Batman.
Listen, I just wanted to say
that I'm really,
really, really,
really, really, really,
really, really...
s-s-s...
Soooo...
Sorry?
Yeah. Whoo! I did it!
I don't even know why
you bothered coming back.
I was
afraid.
What?
The reason I came back
was the same reason I left you.
I was afraid
of feeling
the pain you feel
when you lose
someone close to you.
Gotham needs us.
So I came back to do this.
Flip.
Flip? What is that? I don't...
You gotta turn around.
I call it the Babs-Signal.
And I'm flipping the switch for you.
Because saving this city
is too big a job for one person.
Flip, flip.
So, what do you say, Commish?
Will you work with me?
I need your help.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
But there's still only four of us
against Joker's entire army.
That's why I called in some backup.
Flip! Flip! Flip! Flip!
- Whoa!
- We saw your signal,
and we came to help.
Joker may be done with us,
but we're not done with him.
We will be the Joker's reckoning.
Joker said mean stuff to us.
You were right, Barbara.
It takes a village. Not a Batman.
Okay. Everybody, listen up.
These monsters want to destroy
Gotham City.
That's right. We need sick new vehicles.
An arsenal of advanced weaponry.
Costumes that suit
our individual personalities.
Rip!
And code names
to use on our walkie-talkies.
Call it out!
Your name is Lady Bat.
- Lady Bat?
- Bat Lady.
- Veto! Nope. What?
- El Batarina. Soccer Mom... Bat?
How about a cool costume?
Nice!
That one's called Batgirl.
If you call me Batgirl,
can I call you Batboy?
And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy,
and a kick-butt theme song!
Robin?
My superhero code name.
Oh, yeah. Hit it!
Got it!
No!
Absolutely not.
This music is filling me with rage.
Let's use it!
All right, team. I'm going to need to
know your special powers.
I'm a giant clay person!
- I'm irritating.
- I have a sack for a face.
I make unpredictable decisions.
I raise the stakes!
I can squirt ketchup!
Nice! Orca.
I'm a whale!
Oh, we got this covered!
Go team!
Whale, yeah!
Shh. Quiet.
Who's laying down those funky beats?
- We are!
- Meow, meow!
Batman?
Evil army, get rid of them!
Team Gotham Family,
activate!
Voldy's got this.
Here we go!
Yeah!
Bombarda!
Smash! Smash! Smash!
- Whoa.
- Batman, take out Joker's bomb.
I'll get that Projector!
10-4, Co-Go.
Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!
Coming through!
Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.
Bringing it, sir. For Queen and country!
You just got Union Jacked!
Robin, get ready.
I'm about to teach you
some father-and-son stuff.
First, driving.
- Put your hands at 10 and 2.
- Okay.
Now, fly! Turn left!
Run over these skeletons.
Now drive up the wall!
- Great driving.
- Thanks, Padre.
Yeah!
Okay, Robin.
Together, we're gonna
punch these guys so hard,
words describing the impact
are gonna spontaneously materialize
out of thin air.
Yeah!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
High five!
Stop moving around, you Muggles.
All right, team, let's shut him down.
Orca! You're up, baby!
You wanna see a magic trick?
I'm gonna make you disappear.
- Wingardium Levio...
- Me-yoink!
Wingardium Levio... Shut up!
No!
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!
Fudgecake!
Whoo! Here we go, Bat Team!
Batman, think fast!
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!
Robin, go long.
- Nice grab.
- Yeah!
Oh, my gosh. Yes!
Here you go, Grandpa.
Hey, Batman!
Get off my padre!
It wasn't useless after all.
End this, Batgirl!
Adis, shark.
Okay, BRB, guys.
I'm gonna go defuse that...
This is the end of Gotham City!
As I predicted, we're doomed!
We're not doomed. I got this.
Everyone, grab on to me.
Gotcha.
Come on, guys.
We need to hold this city together.
Batrope, no!
Everybody, run!
No! We have to stick together.
Right, Batman?
We need to use our heads!
Maybe we should build something together.
- Heads.
- Stick together.
- Build something.
- Together.
- Build.
- Together. Together.
We should build something together.
I got it.
You're right, Babs.
We need to stick together.
Literally.
Robin, quick. Give me a boost.
On it, Padre.
We're gonna stick together,
using our heads,
and the most powerful weapon of all.
Shredded abs. Let's do this.
- Meow, meow.
- Yeah, let's do this.
- Ready?
- Here we go.
You got this, Alfred?
Yes, sir. Abs of steel.
Great! Now you bend,
and I'll grab the other side!
No!
- Batman, what's going on?
- Are you okay?
I've got you.
Joker!
Please, help us!
No! I'm not gonna help you.
At least if this city is destroyed,
I'll die knowing
I'm your greatest enemy!
I'm gonna have to die to know it.
Shut up, Joker! If there's no Gotham,
then I'll never get to fight you again.
What?
You're the reason why I get up
at 4:00 in the afternoon
and pump iron
until my chest is positively sick.
You're the reason I've given up
a life spent with Russian ballerinas
and lady activewear models.
And if it wasn't for you,
I never would have learned how connected
I am with all these people.
And you.
So if you help me save Gotham,
you'll help me save us.
You just said "us."
Yeah. Batman and the Joker.
What do you say?
You had me at shut up.
How are your abs, bro?
Too much flab, not enough ab. Why?
Because I need you to crunch them.
Citizens of Gotham,
we need all of you to join us
and help bring this city back together.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
I hate you, Joker.
- I hate you, too.
- I hate you more.
I hate you the most.
I hate you forever.
Splendid!
We did it, everyone!
Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.
Padre,
where are you going?
I made a promise.
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.
Sorry, kid.
Padre, please.
Don't call me Padre.
Okay.
Call me...
Dads.
My two dads are the same dad.
But they're both leaving.
It's gonna be okay, kid.
Sometimes, losing people is part of life.
But that doesn't mean
you stop letting them in.
Some very wise people taught me that.
My father figure.
My platonic coworker buddy,
who's a girl, but just a friend.
And you.
Mi hijo.
It's Spanish
for "son."
This is my family,
but it's your family, too.
Do you have a knife?
Why?
'Cause someone needs to cut the tension
between the two of us immediately.
Okay. I deserved that.
- Hi.
- Wait a minute.
What's going on?
I came back, just like I said I would.
You know, Mr. Batman,
when you're a talking brick,
working at the Phantom Zone,
you see a lot of crazy things.
But I've finally seen a man,
in order to make the world a better place,
take a look at himself and make a change.
Who?
- Superman.
- What?
I'm kidding. It's you.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you
on the streets, Batman.
I guess so. Catch you later, Joker.
Let's go, gang.
Wait a minute,
we're not just gonna
let these criminals go, right?
Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it.
Those guys are no match
for the four of us.
We'll give them a 30-minute head start.
Besides, you can't fight crime
on an empty stomach.
Hey, Computer?
We're home!
What is the password?
Iron Man sucks!
When Dad and me were fighting,
I was giving them my best one-liners.
You
complete me.
Holy family photo, Batman. I love it!
White.
All important movies end
with a white screen.
And tying up loose ends.
We're coming for you, Gotham City!
Like this snake clowns bit.
- Snake clowns?
- Told you they were real.
Did you stick wigs onto snakes?
- Maybe.
- That is so weird.
Can I play that song
I wrote for the end credits?
- That is a hard pass.
- Come on.
No!
Let the kid play whatever music he wants.
- No, no, no!
- Please?
- No.
- Padre?
Fine. 'Puter.
Okay, sir.
Yay!
Now playing Robin's happy, poppy music.
The kind that makes
parents and studio executives happy.
Come on, everyone!
- Come on, Batman!
- No!
Wow, that was fun!
Really hope nobody was recording that.
Let me see. Oh, this thing is on.
This thing is recording.

I knew Harvey Dent.
l was his friend.
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.
l believed in Harvey Dent.
Dr. Pavel, l'm CIA.
He wasn't alone.
-Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
-They are not my friends.
Don't worry, no charge for them.
-And why would l want them?
-They were trying to grab your prize.
They work for the mercenary.
The masked man.
-Bane?
-Aye.
Get them onboard. l'll call it in.
The flight plan l just filed
with the agency...
...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...
...but only one of you!
First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?
He didn't fly so good!
Who wants to try next?
Tell me about Bane!
Why does he wear the mask?
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...
...before throwing him out of a plane.
At least you can talk.
Who are you?
lt doesn't matter who we are.
What matters is our plan.
No one cared who l was
till l put on the mask.
lf l pull that off, will you die?
lt would be extremely painful.
You're a big guy.
For you.
Was getting caught part of your plan?
Of course.
Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.
-We had to find out what he told you--
-Nothing. l said nothing.
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!
-Sir?
-Now what's the next step of your master plan?
Crashing this plane...
...with no survivors.
Mayday, Mayday!
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!
No!
No, no, no! No!
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.
Have we started the fire?
Yes, the fire rises.
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.
That comes later.
Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday...
...but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.
This city has seen a historic turnaround.
No city is without crime, but this city is without
organized crime because the Dent Act...
...gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...
...and to them l say, "Not on my watch."
l want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.
l'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
l'm sure he's with us in spirit.
And now l'm gonna give way
to an important voice....
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?
No one has. Not in years.
--people put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.
A thug who showed his true nature...
...when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...
...and murdered him in cold blood.
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.
-Shrimp balls?
-Thank you.
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. l'll let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon.
The truth?
l have...
...written a speech...
...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.
Maybe the time isn't right.
Maybe right now...
...all you need to know
is that there are...
...1 000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.
Maybe, for now, all l should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:
lt has not been for nothing.
-You see the guy who owns the house?
-No. I heard...
-...he never leaves the east wing.
-l heard he had an accident.
-Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a--
-Mr. Till?
Why are your people
using the main staircase?
And where's Mrs. Bolton?
Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can l help?
The east drawing room.
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.
l'm sorry, Miss Tate.
l tried, but he won't see you.
And you mustn't take it personally.
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...
...peeing into Mason jars.
lt's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...
...who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?
He can't get your money back. l can.
l could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...
...so why waste my time indeed?
Second shift reports in?
You should spend more time
with the mayor.
Well, that's your department.
Anyone shown him the crime stats?
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.
-Must be popular with his wife.
-Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.
-Really?
-Mm-hm.
-But he's a hero.
-A war hero. This is peacetime.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
l'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
lt is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
Although you don't have the long nails
or, heh, the facial scars, sir.
ls that what they say about me?
lt's just that no one ever sees you.
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.
lt can't be the same one...
...because her pearls are in this safe...
...the manufacturer clearly explained...
...is uncrackable.
Oops.
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.
l'm afraid l can't let you take those.
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than l would beat up a cripple.
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.
Good night, Mr. Wayne.
Can l have a ride?
You read my mind.
Let's go.
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
She's very persistent.
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.
-l wasn't.
-What are you doing?
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.
And this is your idea
of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.
-She?
-One of the maids.
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.
-Why were you dusting for prints?
-l wasn't.
She was.
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.
That's a job for the police?
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh,
overdue library books.
And yet here you are, like we're still at war.
-What's your name, son?
-Blake, sir.
You have something you want to ask me?
lt's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?
l'm not hearing a question, son.
Don't you want to know who he was?
l know exactly who he was.
He was the Batman.
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.
Master Wayne?
Master Wayne?
You haven't been down here in a long time.
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. l ran her prints.
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...
...she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.
She's good.
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.
We do. l cross-referenced the address
she went back to...
...with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and, um....
Selina Kyle.
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.
She won't. She likes them too much.
And they weren't what she was after.
-What was she after?
-My fingerprints.
lt was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.
lt gives a good pull and it's untraceable.
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.
You're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
At this point, l'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.
There's nothing out there for me.
And that's the problem.
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.
Alfred...
...l did find someone.
l know, and you lost them.
But that's all part of living, sir.
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.
Remember when you left Gotham?
Before all this, before Batman?
You were gone seven years.
Seven years l waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.
Every year, l took a holiday.
l went to Florence.
There's this caf
on the banks of the Arno.
Every fine evening l'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.
l had this fantasy...
...that l would look across the tables...
...and l'd see you there, with a wife.
Maybe a couple of kids.
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.
But we'd both know that you'd made it.
That you were happy.
l never wanted you to come back to Gotham.
l always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.
And l wanted something
more for you than that.
l still do.
They wash up here
a couple of times a month.
More when it gets colder.
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.
-What?
-Name's Jimmy.
He's from St. Swithin's.
lt's the boys' home
where l coach some ball.
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.
-No? Why?
-Blake, you know why.
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 1 6.
l thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.
Not for the past couple of years.
-He has a brother here, doesn't he?
-Mark. l'll tell him.
l'd like to, if that's all right.
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.
Say you can live down there.
Say there's work down there.
Work?
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?
More than you can find up here, l guess.
So you know about him?
Of course.
Do you think he's coming back?
l don't know.
You brought a date?
l like having someone around
to open doors for me.
Right hand. No partials.
-Very nice.
-Mm-hm.
Not so fast, handsome.
You got something for me?
Ah, yes.
l don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...
...but l'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
You don't count so good, huh?
l count fine.
ln fact, l'm counting to 1 0 right now.
Okay.
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."
This place is a little dead.
lt'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.
ls everything okay?
Great. Catch you later.
Hmm.
lt would have been a lot easier...
...to just give me what we agreed.
We can't have loose ends.
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.
No.
But my friend over there?
Every cop in the city's missing him.
That's cute.
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.
l don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.
-Go!
-Go!
Police! Get down now!
Help me! Help me!
Help me, please! Please help me!
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.
Call me?
-You okay, miss?
-He's bleeding. You gotta help him.
l got the congressman.
Clear!
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!
You three, down with me.
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!
What, they went down there?
-We're gonna go down there, right?
-That was a gas explosion, kid.
-Wasn't gas. lt's a sewer.
-No one goes in till we know what's there.
We know, sir. The police commissioner.
Someone get this hothead out of here?
And where's that DWP guy?
Why are you here?
Answer him.
l was asking you.
lt's the police commissioner.
And you brought him down here?
-We didn't know what to do.
-You panicked.
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.
No, he's alone.
Search him.
Then l will kill you.
-He's dead.
-So show me his body.
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.
-Follow him!
-Follow him?
You okay? You okay?
Hey, hey, you awake?
l need to see Bruce Wayne.
l'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.
Even from a police officer.
And if l go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?
That still count as unscheduled?
What can l do for you, officer?
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.
When l pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.
A masked man called Bane.
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.
He needs you.
He needs the Batman.
-lf Commissioner Gordon thinks--
-Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.
But we've met before.
lt was a long time ago. l was a kid.
Uh, St. Swithin's.
lt used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. lt's an orphanage.
My mom died when l was small. lt was
a car accident, l don't really remember it.
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...
...and l remember that one just fine.
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?
To be angry...
...in your bones.
l mean, they understand.
Foster parents.
Everybody understands...
...for a while.
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.
Move on.
So after a while,
they stop understanding.
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.
l figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.
Practice smiling in a mirror.
lt's like putting on a mask.
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.
Pretty girl on your arm.
We were so excited.
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.
l mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but....
Right when l saw you,
l knew who you really were.
l'd seen that look on your face before.
lt's the same one l taught myself.
l don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...
...but l'm still a believer in the Batman...
...even if you're not.
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?
Because the money stopped.
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.
Some of those details
might need your help.
You check that name? Bane?
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.
-Now Daggett's brought them here.
-Or so it seems.
-l'll keep digging.
-Yeah.
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.
There have to be some.
-Time to talk to Mr. Fox, l think.
-l'll get him on the phone.
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?
Yes. One or two.
l need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.
-Which hospital?
-Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.
-l have seen worse cartilage in knees.
-That's good.
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...
...the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...
...and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...
-...l cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
-Right.
We were in this together...
...then you were gone.
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
-We won.
-Based on a lie.
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.
The Batman has to come back.
What if he doesn't exist anymore?
He must.
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?
-You f-- You took my wallet!
-No, l--
-Get out.
-She took my-- Ah!
-Now.
-Creep!
l don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.
Probably the watch.
Who's that?
A stiff can barely climb out of his sports car.
-No, that's Bruce Wayne!
-Mr. Wayne, over here!
-l'm not sure if my assistant--
-Right through here.
Thank you so much.
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.
Miss Tate, isn't it?
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
lt's not about charity.
lt's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.
Oh.
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because l paid for the big fat spread myself.
That's very generous of you.
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.
Take our clean-energy project.
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.
-l'm sorry.
-You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.
And isn't so wounded when it fails...
...that he goes into hiding.
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Mind if l cut in?
Thank you.
-You don't seem happy to see me.
-You were supposed to be a shut-in.
l felt like some fresh air.
Why didn't you call the police?
l have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
-Who's your date?
-His wife's in Ibiza.
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.
lt's pronounced "Ibiza."
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.
You think l care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?
l doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.
Well, Selina Kyle, l know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.
A modest place for a master jewel thief.
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...
...or you're in deep with the wrong people.
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
-Actually, l was born in the Regency Room.
-l started out doing what l had to.
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.
Start fresh.
Ugh. There's no fresh start in today's world.
Any 1 2-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.
ls that how you justify stealing?
l take what l need from those
who have more than enough.
l don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.
Robin Hood?
l think l'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.
Ouch.
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...
...you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...
...and leave so little for the rest of us.
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.
l'm adaptable.
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.
But l still can't let you keep them.
You-- You scared her off!
Not likely.
Must have lost my ticket.
-Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
-My wife?
Just you, sir?
Don't worry, Master Wayne.
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.
Bruce Wayne, as l live and breathe.
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?
You haven't lost your sense of humor.
Even if you have lost most of my money.
Actually, you did that.
lf you funnel your entire R and D budget...
...into a fusion project
that you then mothball...
...your company is unlikely to thrive.
What are my options?
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine....
l can't. l can't, Lucius.
Well, then sit tight.
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...
...while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.
She has supported the project
all the way.
She's smart. And quite lovely.
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.
Show her the machine.
l'll think it over.
Anything else?
Nope. Why?
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.
l retired.
Mm-hm. Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.
Just for old times' sake.
l figured you'd have
shut this place down.
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.
All this new stuff.
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.
For years, l've been shuttering
and consolidating...
...all the different prototypes
under one roof.
-My roof.
-Why?
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.
Oh, now you're just showing off.
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.
What's it called?
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.
l just took to calling it the Bat.
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.
Works fine, except for the autopilot.
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.
Better mind?
Well, l was trying to be modest.
A less busy mind.
Yours.
-ls it really painful?
-You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
lf you're seriously considering
going back out there...
...you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.
l'm all ears.
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.
Sometimes the pit sends something back.
-Bane.
-Bane.
Born and raised in hell on earth.
-Born in a prison?
-No one knows why, or how he escaped.
But they do know that once he did...
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?
And then he was excommunicated.
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.
l didn't realize l was known
for trifling with criminals.
That was then.
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...
...but that doesn't make you
what you were.
lf this man is everything that you say he is,
then the city needs me.
The city needs Bruce Wayne.
Your resources. Your knowledge.
lt doesn't need your body, or your life.
That time's past.
You're afraid that if l go back out there,
l'll fail.
No.
l'm afraid that you want to.
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. l vote bad.
On what basis?
l flipped a coin.
lt says rye-- l said no rye, man.
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.
Come on. Let's go scalping.
Come on.
Everybody down, now!
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.
Really? Then why are you people here?
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!
We have an emergency situation!
You gotta get in there!
This is a hostage situation.
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.
l'm not risking my men for your money.
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.
lt's not our money, it's everybody's.
Really? Mine's in my mattress.
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in
your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.
-Thank you.
-That'll slow them down.
Move back!
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!
They cut the fiber.
Cell's working.
For now.
Get all these barriers up. All of them up.
No one gets in or out of any of these streets.
Where am l supposed to move it?
Back it up.
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?
How much longer
does the program need?
Eight minutes.
Time to go mobile.
Everybody, up!
You two, move!
Thank you.
Steady.
Steady.
l've got something.
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.
Hold your fire!
Go, go!
Please! Just let me go!
Hey, please! Hey!
Shoot the tires.
There's no shot.
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.
--P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...
...in response to a hostage situation.
What's going on with the lights?
lt can't be.
What the hell was that?
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.
Please! Help, help, help!
Sorry.
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.
Pull them in now. l'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.
-What's that?
-l'm gonna take down the Batman.
--are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...
...kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.
-Reports from the eyewitnesses--
Scott, dead center of your screen.
-What do you see?
-I see Batman.
Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...
...by what appears to be the Batman.
Well, what do you know?
Sir, what about the armed robbers?
Please! Just let me go! Please!
One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?
Negative. Stay on the Batman.
-He's getting away.
-Who do you wanna catch?
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?
--the entire upper west hill...
...Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.
He's drawing the cops off Bane.
Please! Just let me go!
Please!
We lost him.
How could you lose him?
He's got a lot of firepower.
What, and you don't?
He's heading back downtown.
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.
Close it off, gentlemen.
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.
You sure it was him?
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.
What about the men they arrested?
He said, and l quote,
"They would die before talking."
Where does he find these guys?
Open the champagne.
And can we get some girls in here?
Careful what you wish for.
Cat got your tongue?
You dumb bitch.
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.
You're dumb for coming here tonight.
l want what you owe me.
Want doesn't get.
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?
-l don't know.
-Aah!
Do they?
-So where is it?
-Where's what?
The program. The "clean slate."
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.
Hold it right there!
Where is it?
The clean slate?
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...
...in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?
-Sound a little too good to be true?
-You're lying!
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.
That's why l bought them.
But they had nothing.
lt was a gangland myth.
Stay back!
l'm not bluffing!
They know.
They just don't care.
You've gotta be kidding me.
-No guns. No killing.
-Where's the fun in that?
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.
This isn't a car.
See you around.
You're welcome.
l had it under control.
Those weren't street thugs.
They were trained killers.
l saved your life.
ln return, l need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.
l sold his prints to Daggett...
...for something that doesn't even exist.
-l doubt many people get the better of you.
-Hey, when a girl's desperate....
-What's he gonna do with them?
-l don't know...
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.
Miss Kyle?
So that's what that feels like.
l see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.
l retrieved this.
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?
-They don't have the tools to analyze it.
-They would if you gave them to them.
One man's tool is another man's weapon.
ln your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.
-You thought l didn't have it in me.
-You led a bloated police force on a chase...
...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.
What about when you come up
against him? What then?
-l'll fight harder. l always have.
-Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.
l see the power of belief.
l see the League of Shadows resurgent.
You said he was excommunicated.
By Ra's Al Ghul.
Who leads them now?
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and l beat him.
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.
Trades of some kind. Coded.
And my fingerprint, courtesy of Selina Kyle.
Get this to Fox.
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.
l'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.
l've sewn you up, l've set your bones,
but l won't bury you.
l've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.
-You'll leave me?
-You see only one end to your journey.
Leaving is all l have
to make you understand.
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.
That was my life beyond the cave.
l can't just move on.
She-- She didn't. She couldn't.
What if she had?
She-- l can't change that.
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...
...saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?
And what if...
...to spare you pain...
...l burnt that letter?
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?
l am using the truth, Master Wayne.
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying
to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.
-l'm sorry.
-You're sorry?
You expect to destroy my world...
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?
No, no, no.
l know what this means.
What does it mean?
lt means your hatred.
And it also means losing someone
that l have cared for...
...since l first heard his cries echo...
...through this house.
But it might also mean saving your life.
And that is more important.
Goodbye, Alfred.
Alfred?
-Answering your own door?
-Yeah.
Page three.
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...
...verified by thumbprint.
Those options expired
at midnight last night.
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.
Applied Sciences is all locked up
and off the books.
The energy project, however,
is a different story.
Miranda Tate.
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?
Bear with me, Miss Tate.
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.
This is it, isn't it?
The reactor is beneath the river...
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.
ls Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?
l'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.
l thought you might like to see
what your investment built.
No fossil fuels.
Free clean energy for an entire city.
Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper...
...on weaponized fusion reactions.
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.
l think this machine works.
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...
...died in a plane crash six months ago?
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.
l need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...
...and this reactor.
To do what with it?
Nothing.
Until we can guarantee its safety.
And if we can't?
Decommission it. Flood it.
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?
lf the world's not ready, yes.
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.
l'm trusting you.
Doesn't count. You have no choice.
l could have flooded this chamber
at any time.
l'm choosing to trust you.
Please.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.
l'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.
And he himself has run it.
lnto the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...
...it's cost us all a lot of money.
And he has to go.
l'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.
Now, back to business.
-Mr. Wayne, over here!
-How's it feel to be one of the people?
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car!
l didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.
Looks like you need a ride, huh?
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?
-Not that we know of.
-You don't know much of anything, do you?
-Where's Bane?
-We told him it was urgent.
-Where is that masked--?
-Speak of the devil...
...and he shall appear.
What the hell is going on?
-The plan is proceeding as expected.
-Oh, really?
Do l look like l'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?
-Leave us.
-No. You stay here.
l'm in charge.
Do you feel in charge?
l've paid you a small fortune.
And this gives you power over me?
What is this?
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...
...till now.
What are you?
l'm Gotham's reckoning.
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.
You're pure evil.
l'm necessary evil.
No. No, no, no!
When you started, why the mask?
-To protect the people closest to me.
-But you were a loner, right?
-You didn't have any family?
-There are always people you care about.
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.
The idea was to be a symbol.
Batman could be anybody.
That was the point.
-Well, it was damn good to see him back.
-Not everybody agrees.
-They'll figure that out in the end.
-You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
Yeah. l got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.
l could use some help, actually.
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.
Hey, hey, hey. l don't think so!
-That's the way this works!
-l don't think so!
-That is the way--
-He's not a mark.
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.
Actually, they're letting me keep the house.
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.
-And how would he do that?
-By giving you what you want.
-lt doesn't exist.
-He says it does.
He wants to meet tonight.
Why?
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.
-Tell him l'll think about it.
-Okay.
l like your place.
Mr. Wayne?
l'm sorry they took all your money.
No, you're not.
-Can we help you, officer?
-Uh, yeah.
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.
-Thought you might want to know.
-Why?
His name's all over these permits l just
pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.
We've had teams down there.
lt's a huge network.
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
l want him found.
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.
We could use some hotter heads
around here.
-Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
-You're a detective now, son.
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.
Nobody's answering.
No.
l'm on my own now.
Do you have keys?
Never needed them.
Hope you didn't like me for my money.
Suffering builds character.
l'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce.
Who's this?
Where's Alfred?
He left...
...taking everything.
What's that?
My power's been shut off.
You're good at that.
When l was a child,
we had almost nothing.
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.
l assumed your family was wealthy.
Not always.
Not when l was young.
An old mistake.
l've made a few myself.
More than a few.
We could leave.
Tonight.
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.
Someday, perhaps.
Not tonight.
Don't be shy.
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.
-That depends.
-On what?
On what you want it for.
l acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.
Still don't trust me, huh?
How can we change that?
Start by taking me to Bane.
You asked.
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.
And they're not your average brawlers.
Neither am l.
-He's behind you.
-Who?
Me.
What do you think you're--?
Just a little further.
l had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.
You made a serious mistake.
Not as serious as yours, l fear.
Bane.
Let's not stand on ceremony here...
...Mr. Wayne.
Peace has cost you your strength.
Victory has defeated you.
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?
Members of the League of Shadows.
And you betrayed us.
"Us"? You were excommunicated...
...by a gang of psychopaths.
l am the League of Shadows.
And l'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.
You fight like a younger man.
Nothing held back.
Admirable, but mistaken.
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?
But you merely adopted the dark.
l was born in it.
Molded by it.
l didn't see the light
until l was already a man.
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!
l will show you where
l have made my home...
...whilst preparing to bring justice.
Then l will break you.
Your precious armory.
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.
Ah, yes. l was wondering
what would break first.
Your spirit...
...or your body.
Get me Commissioner Gordon. l got a line
on the congressman's kidnapping.
-Excuse me, miss.
-Uh, yes?
l'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.
Oh. Do you mind?
l showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.
Don't tell me. Still in love?
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.
-Girl's gotta eat.
-And you have an appetite.
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.
Maybe it's not you l'm running from.
Who then? Bane?
What do you know about him?
That you should be as afraid of him
as l am.
We can offer you protection.
Okay.
When l spotted you, l was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.
Did they kill him?
l'm not sure.
Why didn't you just...
...kill me?
You don't fear death, you welcome it.
Your punishment must be more severe.
Torture?
Yes.
But not of your body.
Of your soul.
Where am l?
Home.
Where l learned the truth about despair.
As will you.
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:
Hope.
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...
...has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.
So easy.
So simple.
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...
...many have died trying.
l learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.
So as l terrorize Gotham...
...l will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.
l will let them believe
that they can survive...
...so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.
You can watch me torture an entire city.
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.
We will destroy Gotham.
And then, when it is done...
...and Gotham is...
...ashes...
...then you have my permission to die.
You're locking her up in here?
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 1 6.
Little closer, baby.
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?
She's gonna be fine.
l still don't see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project.
Bruce got a lot of things right.
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.
How good of you to join us.
Chair. President.
All l need now is one more
ordinary board member.
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
No.
l will volunteer.
Where are you taking us?
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?
What happened?
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!
The mayor won't want panic.
So it's a training exercise.
l'm sorry l didn't take you seriously.
Not you.
You're telling me the Batman's gone...
...so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.
Yes, sir.
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.
l told him. l told him you have nothing.
Do it for the pleasure.
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.
He will try the climb.
Has anyone ever made it?
Of course not.
He says there is one who did.
A child.
A child born in this hell.
Bane.
An old legend. Nothing more.
Don't.
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.
Fire in the hole!
Turn it on.
l only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.
l won't do it.
All right, stop.
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...
...and you'll barely slow them down.
Go on, then. Do your work.
Take them up to the surface.
People of their status...
...deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.
l've been to half of Daggett's cement
plants and locations they poured underground.
Anything strange about the pourings?
Honestly, commissioner, l don't know
anything about civil engineering.
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.
lt's done.
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.
Pull the core out of the reactor.
No, you cannot.
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.
lf you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.
Five, by my calculations.
And then it will go off!
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...
...indeed l hope it does.
Hey. Hey!
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?
-When?
-When?
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.
-Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
-Detective now.
And, uh, as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?
Commissioner, it's Blake.
l got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev--
Wait a minute. l'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.
That looks like motor oil right next to it.
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.
-Patch me in to Foley.
-Foley's overseeing the operation.
They're heading into a trap!
We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.
-Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
-lt's a training exercise, that's all.
Now if you'll excuse me, l've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.
-Foley.
-lt's a trap! Pull everyone out!
Bane has been pouring concrete...
-...laced with explosives!
-Where?
Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's....
There's a ring around the tunnels!
They'll blow it and trap the cops underground!
Pull them out. Pull them out now!
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through--
That's a lovely, lovely voice.
--that our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Let the games begin.
Everybody okay?
-Let's move! Move, move!
-Go, go!
Gotham...
...take control.
Take control of your city.
-Foley.
-Jesus, Blake.
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.
Not every cop.
Sir, are you okay? l'm a police officer.
l need your car right now.
Clear the corners, rookie.
Get my coat, son.
This....
This is the instrument of your liberation.
Satellite shows a radiation spike.
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.
ldentify yourself to the world.
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.
Pavel was confirmed dead.
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but....
lt looks like it's him.
And what...? What is this?
lt's a fully primed neutron bomb...
...with a blast radius of six miles.
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?
Only me.
Only you.
Thank you, good doctor!
Now, this bomb is armed!
And this bomb is mobile!
And the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery.
For one of you holds the detonator!
Now, we come here
not as conquerors...
...but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...
...or from those people
attempting to flee...
...this anonymous Gothamite...
...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.
For now, martial law is in effect.
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...
...and wait.
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.
Pull back the fighters.
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.
Get the president on the line.
Tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device.
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.
How many of you are there, son?
You don't have enough men to stop
1 2 million people from leaving this island.
No. No, we don't.
But you do.
Now, why the hell would l try
to help you keep your hostages?
lf one person crosses this bridge...
...Gotham gets blown to hell.
The people of our greatest city are resilient.
They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.
We do not negotiate with terrorists...
...but we do recognize realities.
As this situation develops...
...one thing must be understood
above all others.
People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.
What does that mean?
lt means we're on our own.
l have to get in front of a camera.
They will kill you the second
you show your face.
Bane says he's giving Gotham back
to the people. They need to know l could lead.
Bane's not gonna let that happen.
Then he'll show his true colors.
And you'll be dead.
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.
Blackgate Prison...
...where a thousand men have languished...
...under the name of this man:
Harvey Dent.
Who has been held up to you...
...as the shining example of justice!
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera.
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you...
...tearing down this corrupt city!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...
...James Gordon:
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent.
He saved my boy...
...then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...
...so that l could, to my shame...
...build a lie around this...
...fallen idol.
l praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.
Well, l can no longer live with my lie.
lt is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...
...and it is time for me to resign."
And do you accept this man's resignation?
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?
Of all the corrupt?
Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate...
...and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.
Gotham needed a hero.
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...
...when the rules aren't weapons anymore...
...they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.
One day, you may face...
...such a moment of crisis.
And in that moment,
l hope you have a friend like l did...
...to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.
We take Gotham from the corrupt!
The rich!
The oppressors of generations...
...who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.
And we give it back to you...
...the people.
Gotham is yours!
None shall interfere. Do as you please.
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!
Open it!
Step forward, those who would serve...
...for an army will be raised.
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...
...and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure!
Courts will be convened.
Spoils will be enjoyed.
Blood will be shed!
The police will survive...
...as they learn to serve true justice.
This great city...
...it will endure.
Gotham will survive!
He says you must first fix your back.
How does he know?
He was the prison doctor.
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...
...of powerful people,
including your masked friend.
How?
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.
The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...
...left him in perpetual agony.
The mask holds the pain at bay.
Bane was the child you spoke of?
He was born here?
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.
They were married in secret.
When the warlord found out...
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.
But then he exiled him instead.
The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.
But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.
She took his place in the pit.
And she was with child...
...the mercenary's child.
lnnocence cannot flower underground.
lt has to be stamped out.
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.
But the child had a friend...
...a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.
lt was to be prized.
The mother was not so lucky.
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.
lt has to be put back.
Stay like this until you stand.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Did you not think l would return, Bruce? Hmm?
l told you l was immortal.
l watched-- l watched you die.
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.
Once, l had a wife...
...my great love.
-She was taken from me.
-You were the mercenary.
Bane is your child.
Your heir.
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...
...to restore balance to civilization.
No.
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...
...with all your strength...
...all your resources,
all your moral authority.
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.
No.
-And must be allowed to die.
-No!
Yeah, just lift your head.
Oh, that's good.
No, no!
-What's that?
-This was someone's home.
And now it's everyone's home.
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.
lt's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.
Any news? ls the commissioner--?
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.
lt's good to see you.
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.
Why build yourself?
-l'm not meant to die in here.
-Here, there. What's the difference?
l told you it could not be done.
You told me a child did it.
But no ordinary child.
A child born in hell.
Forged from suffering.
Hardened by pain.
Not a man from privilege.
We got boots on the ground, sir.
Just waiting on intel.
You have ID?
Of course not.
-Well, how can we trust you?
-We don't have any choice.
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.
Captain. Glad to have you here.
lt's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?
Well, there's dozens.
l'd rather not say exactly.
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.
-Condition?
-Getting food and water.
-Can we break them out?
-Yes, sir.
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.
Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 1 0 at a time.
l'm in contact with my partner
who's down there. They're just waiting.
-Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
-Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.
What about the bomb?
Satellite can't pick up radiation hot spots.
They keep it on a truck.
lt must have a lead-lined roof.
-They move it constantly.
-Good. So you know the truck?
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.
Decoy.
-You don't really think he's coming back?
-Doesn't matter what l think.
Actually, it does. You should put your faith
in something a little more real.
-The routes don't vary much.
-Okay. What about the triggerman?
No leads. lt's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.
-We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
-You gonna tell him what's really going on?
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.
There's someone you need to meet.
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.
What corporation?
Wayne Enterprises. You good?
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
l have to take responsibility for it.
-Why?
-We built it.
You built the bomb?
lt was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.
-Here's the important part.
-As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...
...it becomes increasingly unstable...
...to the point of detonation.
This bomb is a time bomb.
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...
...or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.
-Could you disarm it?
-l could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
-Let's move from this location and call it in.
-Right. Let's go.
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.
Someone sold us out.
Go, go, go!
l'll die before l talk.
l'm on your schedule, captain.
There were people living upstairs.
Round them up for judgment...
...and hang them where the world can see.
Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...
...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt--
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.
My body makes the jump.
Survival is the spirit. The soul.
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.
Fear is why you fail.
No, l'm not afraid.
l'm angry.
Bruce.
Why do we fall?
You do not fear death.
You think this makes you strong.
lt makes you weak.
Why?
How can you move faster than possible...
...fight longer than possible...
...without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?
The fear of death.
l do fear death.
l fear dying in here...
...while my city burns.
There's no one there to save it.
Then make the climb.
How?
As the child did...
...without the rope.
Then fear will find you again.
Ah, supplies for your journey?
Oh, that's wonderful. That's....
What does that mean?
Rise.
No.
No, there's been a mistake!
Take me to Bane!
l want to see Bane!
Order!
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.
You are Philip Stryver...
...executive vice president
of Daggett lndustries...
...who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...
...of people less powerful than him.
Call Bane. l am one of you.
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.
Now, the choice is yours.
Exile or death!
Order!
Exi-- Exile.
Sold.
To the man in the cold sweat.
You follow the thick ice.
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.
Has anyone made it?
Where are they?
lt's not like we have a lot of time.
How long?
The bomb goes off tomorrow.
-We have about 1 8 hours to do something.
-To do what?
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so
we can start to figure out how to bring it down.
That's it?
Foley.
-Where's Foley, damn it?
-You shouldn't be out on the streets.
-Jim, he's not here.
-You let your wife come to the door?
-When the city's under occupation?
-Wait in the kitchen, honey.
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?
You think this is part of some revolution?
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.
-lf you still had a family here--
-This only gets fixed from inside...
...the city!
Look, Peter.
l'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.
-Sorry, Jim. l gotta--
-Keep your head down?
What good's that gonna do
when that thing blows?
You don't know that's gonna happen.
l hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.
How about me instead?
Miss Tate, l, uh, can't ask you to do that.
Please.
You little punk! What'd you take?
Nothing! l didn't take anything!
You steal from us, you little bastard?
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.
You're pretty generous for a thief.
-l thought they killed you.
-Not yet.
-lf you're expecting an apology, l--
-lt wouldn't suit you.
l need your help.
And why would l help you?
For this. Clean slate.
You'd trust me with that?
After what l did to you?
l'll admit, l was a little let down.
But l still think there's more to you.
ln fact, l think that for you...
...this isn't just a tool.
lt's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.
-l can't even get off this island.
-l can give you a way off...
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.
Why do you need Fox?
-To save the city.
-Who says it needs saving?
Maybe l like it this way.
Maybe you do...
...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.
Got your powerful friend on the case?
l'm trying...
...but l need Fox.
As it approaches...
...flip the switch.
The needle hits 200, you give me the signal,
l'll mark the truck. Okay?
Heads up, heads up.
-l got it.
-Mercenaries on your 6.
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.
On whose authority?
The people of Gotham.
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.
Now, what will it be?
Death or exile?
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...
...you have another thing coming.
Death, then.
-Looks that way.
-Very well.
Death...
...by exile.
Bring her to me.
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.
We all do.
lt's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.
-Bruce.
-You okay?
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.
How long until that core ignites?
-That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
-Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.
-Can you get Miranda out of here?
-Not tonight. l'm sorry.
-Do what's necessary.
-Tonight l need you.
-What for?
-To get me back in the game.
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.
-l won't forget about you, Miranda.
-l know.
l like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
He should be so lucky.
Any move l make on Bane or the bomb...
...the triggerman sets it off.
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.
lnfrared doesn't have the range.
lt'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.
-Could you block it?
-Yes.
But l'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.
Remember where you parked?
She fly okay?
Yeah, even without the autopilot.
-Thanks.
-Autopilot? That's what you're there for.
Okay. lt's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.
Wait, wait!
Ross!
Ross?
-Lock it up.
-No, keep down.
Get down!
Who are you?
Light it up.
-Dad, check it out.
-Honey, come take a look.
lmpossible.
Keep her close.
He'll come for her.
Where's Miranda Tate?
Bane took her.
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.
When what starts?
War.
You missed a spot.
-lf you're working alone, wear a mask.
-l'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.
The mask is not for you.
lt's to protect the people you care about.
Count to five, then throw.
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?
-What now?
-All-out assault on Bane.
But you need to get people
across the bridge.
-Why?
-ln case we fail.
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.
You don't need me here?
You've given me an army.
Now go.
Hey, thanks.
Don't thank me yet.
Well, l might not get a chance later.
You shouldn't have.
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...
...but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.
Wait until the fighting begins.
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?
To start it, throttle--
-l got it.
-We have 45 minutes to save this city.
No, l've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.
-You don't stand a chance against these guys.
-With your help, l might.
l'll open that tunnel, then l'm gone.
There's more to you than that.
Sorry to keep letting you down.
Come with me.
Save yourself.
You don't owe these people any more.
You've given them everything.
Not everything.
Not yet.
Disperse!
Disperse or be fired upon!
There's only one police in this town.
Open fire.
-Here it comes!
-Get ready!
So you came back to die with your city.
No. l came back to stop you.
Now!
That's impossible.
Cut over to Fifth!
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.
You, come with me. You too.
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?
Go, go, go!
ls he back?
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.
Cover the doors!
Where's your trigger?!
Where is it?!
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!
Where is it? Where's your trigger?
Where is it?! Where is it?!
Tell me where the trigger is.
Then you have my permission to die.
l broke you.
How have you come back?
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?
Where's the trigger?
But l never escaped.
But the child.
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.
l am.
And though l'm not ordinary...
...l am a citizen.
Miranda?
Why?
Talia.
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...
...the way l would have been killed,
if not for my protector...
...Bane.
Goodbye.
l climbed out of the pit.
l found my father...
...and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.
But by that time...
...the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.
My protector.
The League took us in.
Trained us.
But my father could not accept Bane.
He saw only a monster.
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.
His only crime was that he loved me.
l could not forgive my father.
Until you murdered him.
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.
lnnocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.
l honor my father by finishing his work.
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.
You see...
...it's the slow knife...
...the knife that takes its time.
The knife...
...that waits years without forgetting...
...then slips quietly between the bones.
That's the knife...
...that cuts deepest.
Please.
Maybe your knife...
...was too slow.
The truck is under attack.
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.
No matter.
He's bought Gotham 1 1 minutes.
Come on!
This way!
Stay there! What are you doing?
Blake, MCU!
l'm getting these boys to safety!
You'll get us all killed!
lf anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!
lt's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!
lf you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.
Don't kill him,
l want him to feel the heat.
Feel the fire of 12 million souls you failed.
Goodbye, my friend.
Goodbye.
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!
Shoot them.
Shoot them all.
We both know that l have to kill you now.
You'll just have to imagine the fire.
About the whole no-guns thing...
...l'm not sure l feel as strongly
about it as you do.
Pull up.
Stay level.
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.
l need you on the ground,
l'll be in the air. Go.
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.
l'm a cop, like you,
and l'm walking out there.
Please do not shoot me!
Shoot at his feet.
Nothing like a little air superiority.
Detective! Please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!
Stop walking!
Blow it! Do it!
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 1 0 minutes.
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.
You idiots!
You sons of bitches!
You're killing us!
Yeah, follow your orders!
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.
lt's on my side.
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back
on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!
-Back on the bus!
-There's nowhere to go.
On the bus!
You've got to turn the truck east!
Stay straight!
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!
Fox showed me how to override
the reactor.
Oh, dear.
lncluding the emergency flood.
There's no way...
...this bomb...
...will be stopped.
What are you doing?
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!
lt's an atom bomb!
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!
Prepare yourselves.
My father's work...
...is done.
-What are you doing?
-l can get it out over the bay!
Set it to fly out over the water, then eject?
No autopilot.
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.
So did you.
l guess we're both suckers.
-l never cared who you were.
-And you were right.
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?
A hero can be anyone.
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...
...as putting a coat around a young boy's
shoulders to let him know...
...the world hadn't ended.
Bruce Wayne?
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.
Hey, heads down! This is it!
-No.
-No, that's Batman!
That's detonation!
lt's out over the bay! Clear of the city!
"l see a beautiful city...
...and a brilliant people...
...rising from this abyss.
l see the lives for which
l lay down my life...
...peaceful...
...useful, prosperous and happy.
l see that l hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...
...and in the hearts
of their descendants...
...generations hence.
lt is a far, far better thing that l do...
...than l have ever done.
lt is a far, far better rest that l go to...
...than l have ever known."
l'm so sorry.
l failed you.
You trusted me...
...and l failed you.
Can l change your mind...
...about quitting the force?
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?
You were right, and l can't take it.
The injustice.
l mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.
They know.
lt was the Batman.
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...
...and the remainder is left in its entirety
to Alfred J. Pennyworth.
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.
My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.
Blake, John.
-Nothing here.
-Uh, try my legal name.
You should use your full name.
l like that name.
-Robin.
-Thanks.
Why worry about
the stabilization software?
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.
Please, l just need to know
what l could've done to fix it.
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.
Check the ID on the patch.
Bruce Wayne.
-Any news on the missing item?
-Not yet.
They better leave no stone unturned.
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.

Hey!
...a dark and stormy Halloween.
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.
Our top story tonight,
just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Rel in a dead heat.
Things certainly got hot last night
in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.
Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,
established by the great Thomas Wayne.
Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall
and the safety net
for those who need it.
The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.
Now wait... Now hang on.
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.
Under my administration,
the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.
The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.
It's gotten worse.
I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
But listen...
I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?
And I will not rest...
Hey.
Yeah, I'm watching it now.
Why is she still tied?
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.
Just call me in the morning, okay?
...who still believes in
everything this city can do.
We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.
Thursday, October 31st.
The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.
Even with the rain.
Hidden in the chaos is the element,
waiting to strike like snakes.
But I'm there too.
Watching.
Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.
I must choose my targets carefully.
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!
It's a big city.
I can't be everywhere.
But they don't know where I am.
Look at this guy, man.
Boom!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!
Yo, let's see your hits.
That's you.
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.
But when that light hits the sky,
it's not just a call.
It's a warning.
To them.
Fear...
is a tool.
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!
They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
Come on!
But I am the shadows.
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help, help!
Where you goin', huh?
Come on.
Come on, man. Break it.
You can't move, huh?
Now knock his ass out.
Showtime. Showtime, man.
Come on, man.
Come on. Do it, man.
You see this guy?
The hell are you supposed to be?
I'm vengeance.
Holy shit. It's him.
Hey, man. No, no, no!
Please don't hurt me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Police action.
He's with me, Officer.
Are you kidding me, sir?
You're gonna let him in here?
Martinez, let him through.
Goddamn freak.
What do we know?
Detective?
Sorry, Lieutenant.
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.
All this blood is from his head?
No.
Excuse me.
Most of it's from his hand.
Thumb was severed.
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.
He was alive when it was cut off.
Ecchymosis...
around the wound.
Security detail downstairs
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.
The mayor was up here alone.
Killer may have come
through the skylight.
You said there was a card.
Yeah.
"From your secret friend. Whoo?
Haven't a clue?
Let's play a game, just me and you.
What does a liar do when he's dead?"
There's a cipher too.
Any of this mean anything to you?
What's going on here?
I asked him to come, Pete.
This is a crime scene.
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!
I got the press downstairs.
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.
But this is way over the line.
Wait.
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.
How do you know?
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.
He lies still.
Excuse me?
The riddle.
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.
Oh, Jesus.
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Excuse me, Commissioner.
They're ready for your statement.
I want him outta here.
Now!
Come on.
Yeah.
The kid found him.
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?
We really gotta go, man.
Tonight, a son lost a father.
A wife lost a husband.
And I lost a friend.
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.
This was a truly senseless crime,
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.
I've spoken to the governor...
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,
but I don't know.
Murder, robberies, assault.
Two years later, they're all up.
And now this.
The city's eating itself.
Maybe it's beyond saving.
But I have to try.
Push myself.
These nights all roll together in a rush
behind the mask.
Sometimes in the morning,
I have to force myself to remember
everything that happened.
Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
was found murdered last night
inside his home
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.
Exact details of the crime
still have not been released,
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.
And this certainly is not the first time
Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.
I assume you heard about this.
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
All this blood is from his head?
Dear God.
There's a cipher too.
Any of this mean anything to you?
The killer left this for the Batman?
I asked him to come, Pete.
Apparently.
You're becoming quite a celebrity.
Why is he writing to you?
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!
I don't know yet.
I got the press downstairs.
Have a shower.
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises
are coming for breakfast.
Here? Why?
Because I couldn't get you to go there.
I haven't got time for this.
It's getting serious, Bruce.
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.
I don't care about that.
Any of that.
You don't care about
your family's legacy?
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.
If I can't change things here,
if I can't have an effect,
then I don't care what happens to me.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Alfred, stop.
You're not my father.
I'm well aware.
We really gotta go, man.
Some fresh berries there.
What are you doing?
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.
This is actually quite elusive.
Where'd you get those O's?
"He lies still" is only a partial key.
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,
see where it leads.
That's interesting.
Mr. Pennyworth?
Yes, Dory?
The accountants are here.
See them in, please, Dory.
What if it's not a partial key?
What do you mean?
What if this is the whole key?
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...
Blank. Yeah, I understand.
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.
I don't see how that's gonna...
Oh.
Damn.
Yeah, he's got a car.
Guess it's good to be the mayor.
Where to even start?
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.
You don't trust me?
You mean like you trust me?
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.
There.
What are we looking for?
A USB port.
USB?
What?
"Thumb" drive.
Jesus.
It's encrypted.
Try this.
Oh, this guy's hilarious.
Oh, well, well, well.
So much for family values.
Who is she?
No idea.
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.
I know who he is.
What was that?
Shit, shit! The drive.
It sent out the photos from my account.
Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.
Jesus.
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.
"He lies still."
About her?
Maybe.
That's the Iceberg Lounge.
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.
Never get in there without a warrant.
Yeah.
Know who I am?
Yeah. I got an idea.
I want to see the Penguin.
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.
What's the problem?
Says he wants to see the Penguin.
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.
That's what I tried to tell him.
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.
Mine or yours?
Get him!
I saw that whole thing.
He's over there!
What is your problem?
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy, sweetheart.
You looking for me?
I see you met the twins.
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?
I guess we both are.
How you doing?
I'm Oz.
Who is she?
I really don't know, chief.
I might have been coming out
at the same time,
but I wasn't rolling with them.
It's okay, baby.
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.
Thank you, honey.
Here you go, champ.
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.
Is that the mayor?
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.
Don't make me hurt you.
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?
Yeah, I do. Do you?
Look...
I'm just the proprietor, okay?
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.
Tell you one thing.
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.
What? Too soon?
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Hey, it's me.
Baby, what's wrong?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...
On the news?
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.
Uh...
God damn it.
...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
with a younger mystery woman.
In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...
Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...
You're pretty good at that.
Hey! Give me that.
"Kosolov, Annika."
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.
What does she know?
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.
She did seem upset.
Back at your place.
Let's go talk to her.
Anni!
Baby!
Anni!
Anni!
It's gonna be cool this evening.
It's gonna be down into the 40s.
More breaking news this hour
as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.
And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.
Shit, they took my phone.
His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,
Commissioner Pete Savage,
was found dead earlier tonight
inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.
The killer posted the following message
on social media,
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.
Hello, people of Gotham.
This is the Riddler speaking.
On Halloween night,
I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.
But I am not done.
Here is another...
who will soon be losing face.
I will kill again, and again, and again,
until our day of judgment
when the truth about our city
will finally...
be unmasked.
Goodbye!
Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished
30-year career on the GCPD...
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.
At the club.
The Iceberg Lounge?
44 Below.
What is that?
The club within the club.
The real club.
It's a mob hangout.
Is that where you work?
Selina?
No, I just work the bar upstairs.
But I see 'em come in.
Who?
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.
Your basic upstanding citizen types.
You're gonna help me on this.
For your friend.
You got a lot of cats.
I have a thing about strays.
You're not safe here.
I can take care of myself.
Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,
and only days before the election.
Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.
He waited for him at the gym.
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,
when no one else was around.
There's a needle mark on his neck.
Injected him with arsenic.
Rat poison.
Yeah.
That seems to be his theme here.
Look at this thing.
It's a maze.
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?
More symbols.
It's another cipher.
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.
Bastard murders you and your reputation.
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.
I don't get it.
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?
Looks like he got greedy.
You kidding me?
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?
Maybe he's not who you thought.
You make it sound like he had it coming.
He was a cop.
Crossed a line.
"I'm mad about you.
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."
The hell is that?
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?
I don't know.
Lieutenant.
They're coming back.
We got to get out of here.
Come on.
Ow!
I don't know about these things.
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?
I'm just looking for Annika.
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?
Look at me.
Looks good. Here.
I got you. Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Hey, where you goin'?
Hospitality.
That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.
Looks like I broke his nose.
"Kenzie, William."
He's an off-duty cop.
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?
Don't worry. I'm watching you.
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.
Great.
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?
Feels good, doesn't it?
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.
Jesus, I hate dropheads.
Really?
'Cause when I first saw you,
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...
Can we not do this right now?
Wait. Who was that?
Oh, I saw him.
Look back.
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.
I need to see his face.
Jesus.
That's the DA.
Gil Colson.
And he's coming over. You happy?
Talk to him.
Hey. How you doing?
Hi.
I'm Gil.
Hey, aren't you the DA?
Yeah.
Wow. I've seen you on TV.
Is that right?
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,
'cause people are all a little on edge.
Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
Is that right?
I like that.
Do you want to come over?
Sure.
- This is Travis.
- Hey.
You wanna take a seat over there?
- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.
That's half the DA's office.
You know Carla here, huh?
Hi.
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.
Drowning our sorrows.
You want a drop?
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.
Hope you don't mind.
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.
He's wasted.
No shit.
I like this girl.
Oh, hey, I like you too!
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.
He knows so much.
He doesn't know shit, man.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...
Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
- Think maybe you had a little too much.
- Hey. The rat.
- Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.
Hey, what's this about a rat?
I mean...
there was a rat. We had an informant.
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.
He's talking about the Maroni case.
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.
What do you know about that?
Does anybody want a drink?
I want a drink.
Keep him talking.
Wait, where are you going?
She knows Annika.
No, stay on the DA.
I told you I'm looking for my friend.
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
What, you got a death wish?
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.
Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?
Sure thing, Oz.
Hey.
Hey.
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.
How you been?
Yeah, I've been okay.
I was just...
I was just headed back upstairs.
Well...
don't be a stranger.
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.
I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- Forget it.
Wait, what are you doing?
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No! No!
Taxi!
Hey!
I lost you in there.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Oh, you need a ride?
That's me right there.
Taxi!
I'm good.
I hope, uh...
I'll see you around.
Just hold still.
What do you know about
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?
Yeah, sure, there was.
That's the rat we're looking for.
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.
Where are you getting this?
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.
Gil's very nervous.
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.
I worked that case.
Riddler's not after you.
How do you know?
You're not corrupt.
Colson's dirty?
Maybe I, uh...
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.
Who knows how many people it touches.
Politicians. Police. The courts.
It could tear the whole city apart.
Jesus, this is a powder keg.
And Riddler's the match.
You know Carmine Falcone.
I told you it's a mob spot.
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.
I don't have a relationship...
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.
I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?
You know Carmine Falcone.
I told you it's a mob spot.
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.
I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?
Pretty.
She a new friend of yours?
I'm not so sure.
Looks like you upset her.
Shall I take this as a good sign?
What?
Your attire.
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.
Riddler might not be able to resist.
Oh, that reminds me.
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.
The one from the rat maze.
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,
"You are El Rata Alada."
Rata Alada?
"Rat with wings"?
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah.
A stool pigeon.
Where are your cufflinks?
I couldn't find them.
Well, you can't go out like that.
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?
Your father gave them to me.
No more lies! No more lies!
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.
Is that Bruce Wayne?
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!
Hold it.
You good, fellas?
Good.
We're good, Mr. Falcone.
Sir?
Hey!
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?
Hey, watch it, fellas.
You got the prince of the city there.
Some event, huh?
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
Wow. Is that right?
His father saved my life.
I got shot in the chest. Right here.
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.
Operated right on the dining room table.
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.
I remember your face.
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.
"Hippocratic oath."
That's good.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for
coming to today's memorial
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
Our program will begin shortly.
As a reminder, the family asked that
those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory
consider a donation to
the cause most dear to his heart...
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,
our city's safety net.
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.
He got what he deserved.
Know what I mean?
Hey, don't I know you?
Bruce Wayne.
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm sorry?
I'm Bella Rel. I'm running for mayor.
I wouldn't be bothering you here,
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.
Will you walk with me?
Mr. Wayne.
Mr. Wayne.
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.
If I'm elected, I want to change that.
Thank you.
My God.
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?
I want to continue this.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?
Gil Colson is missing.
What?
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.
Christ, not again.
Hey. Mr. Wayne.
You got people looking for him, Jim?
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.
What'd his wife say?
She hadn't heard from him.
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car and show your hands!
Get out!
Get 'em up!
Get out! Show 'em!
Christ, it's Colson.
There's a bomb around his neck!
Let's clear this place out now!
We've got to get this place cleared out!
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.
We don't know if he's in on it.
What's he looking at?
Holy shit.
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.
Please.
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.
I'm so sorry.
Looks like a combination lock.
Can't we just cut it off?
Not if you want to keep your head.
You came.
Who are you?
Me?
I'm nobody.
I'm just an instrument,
here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.
"Unmask"?
Yes.
Let's do it together, okay?
I've been trying to reach you.
You're part of this too.
How am I a part of this?
You'll see.
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.
Say hello to my followers.
We're live.
They're here to watch our little trial.
At the moment,
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,
is dead.
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!
But wait a minute...
Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!
You hear me?
Okay.
I'm giving you a chance.
No one ever gave me a chance.
Now,
ever since I was a child,
I've always loved little puzzles.
For me, they are a retreat
from the horrors of our world.
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.
You want me to do puzzles?
Three riddles in two minutes.
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
Okay, okay. So I just...
You want me to...
Riddle number one...
"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?
- "Justice."
- Huh?
The answer's "justice."
- Justice?
- Yes!
- Oh, God.
- Justice!
And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,
were you not, Mr. Colson?
Of course, of course. Of course.
Riddle number two.
"If you are justice, please do not lie.
What is the price for your blind eye?"
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."
Oh, God. "Bribes"?
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.
Fifty-eight seconds!
- How much?
- Nothing!
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.
What cases?
He didn't ask me that!
Come on! Ten grand.
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.
Last riddle.
"Since your justice is so select,
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?
Twenty seconds.
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?
If I go out this way, it's just me.
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?
- People are watching.
- What people?
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.
- It's the whole system!
- Five!
Four!
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!
Goodbye!
Who do you think he is under there?
Take it easy.
I want to see.
What is that thing? Leather?
What's he got on his eyes?
Who cares?
I want to see his face.
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Relax, God damn it!
You're protecting this guy, Jim?
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.
Colson's blood is on his hands.
Maybe it's on yours.
What'd you say?
He would rather die than talk.
What was he afraid of?
You?
You son of a bitch.
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?
You could be an accessory to murder.
Why are we playing games...
Get him! Come on!
Back off! Back off!
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!
You too now?
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.
Okay, give him the room.
Two minutes.
You listen to me.
We gotta get you out of here.
That would put a lot of heat on you.
Well, you punched me in the face.
Take this key.
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?
Or he moonlights as a cop.
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!
Somebody stop him!
- There he is!
- Freeze!
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.
I did.
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?
I only trust you.
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
You think Penguin's the rat?
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.
DA was a regular too.
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.
The Rata Alada.
The what?
Riddler's latest.
The cipher in the maze.
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.
A penguin's got wings too.
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.
Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.
There's Penguin.
I wonder what's in the bags.
You want to move in?
Let's follow.
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.
I'm here.
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.
It's a drug lab. Drops.
This is a buy.
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.
Or they never shut it down at all.
What are you saying?
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?
This just got complicated.
What do you mean?
Hey! What happened?
You all right?
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.
Jesus.
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?
Is that why you work in the club?
It was all just a score?
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.
Jesus!
Hey, Vengeance!
You think you can
come after my money, huh?
Kenzie! Get the money!
Hey! What the...
Whoa!
Come on! Come on!
This guy's crazy!
Come on! Hey!
Move!
Get out of the way!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
I got you!
I got you!
Take that, you friggin' psycho!
I got you!
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.
Cops caught you doing something.
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.
His drops operation.
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.
What are you, crazy?
That why you killed the girl?
I didn't kill no girl!
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.
But she got too close, right?
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.
But somehow Riddler found out too.
He knows so much about you.
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
Why don't you start harmonizing?
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?
I ain't no rat!
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me
if he heard this kind of talk?
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.
Holy God, what are you showing me here?
- This was around his head!
- Come on!
Open your eyes!
Are you El Rata Alada?
El Rata Alada?
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.
It says you are El Rata Alada.
"You are El Rata"? It says that?
Why, you got something to tell us?
Yeah!
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.
What?
It's "La."
"La" rata.
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?
Jesus! Look at you two.
World's greatest detectives!
Am I the only here knows the difference
between "el" and "la"?
Jesus!
No habla espaol, fellas?
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!
You think he made a mistake?
He doesn't make mistakes.
A rat with wings?
You know what that sounds like to me?
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?
"You are El Rata."
"You are el."
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as...
Wait.
Is that him?
Holy shit.
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.
But in a mansion, in a slum,
I'll never know where I come from.
Do you know what I am?"
Any idea?
Yeah.
It's an orphan.
A mansion in a slum.
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?
It was part of the Wayne estate.
They donated it
after they built the tower.
Let's go.
You guys realize I'm still here, right?
You gonna untie me?
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?
Hey!
You goddamn sons of bitches!
No guns.
Yeah, man. That's your thing.
What's that?
Hey! Hey!
Dropheads.
What the hell is that?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Wasn't that beautiful?
Thank you all. Thank you, uh...
Thank you for coming today.
I believe in Gotham.
I believe in its promise.
But too many have been left behind
for too long,
and that's why I'm here today.
To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.
Win or lose,
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation
to start a charitable endowment
for public works.
I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects
who need it now,
like these children behind me.
"Sins of the father."
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...
...and renewing Gotham's promise.
Shall be visited upon the son.
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.
Hey!
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!
- Oh, Mr. Wayne...
- Listen to me!
Something terrible is gonna happen!
I'm afraid it already has, sir.
About an hour ago.
I'm so sorry.
I've been trying to reach you.
The package was intended for you.
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.
We've sedated him.
We just have to hope he stabilizes.
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.
Is there anyone else to notify?
Next of kin?
No.
It's just me.
Selina?
Can you see me?
- Yeah, I can see you.
- I need to talk to you.
Where can we go?
Cat burglar pulling another score?
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...
How could they do that to her?
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.
Her body was in his car.
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.
She didn't know any better.
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means your choices have consequences.
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.
- Was it worth it?
- What?
Compromising yourself for money?
What did you have to do
to set up that score?
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.
Falcone owes me that money.
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.
Oh, really? Why's that?
You know what? I can't even talk to you.
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.
Because he's my father!
My mother worked at the 44 Below.
Just like Anni.
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.
To the club?
Yeah.
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.
Used to see him there.
He scared the shit out of me.
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.
Strangled.
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,
and he didn't say a thing.
Couldn't even look at me.
He owes me that money.
I'm sorry.
For what I said.
Oh, it's all right.
You assume the worst in people.
Which, well...
maybe we're not so different after all.
Who are you under there?
What are you hiding?
Are you just...
hideously scarred?
Yeah.
Listen to me.
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.
I think you'd be on his side.
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
What, do you live in a cave?
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,
will you help me?
Please.
Come on, Vengeance.
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...
I told you, baby.
I can take care of myself.
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.
From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...
...instilled in both of us
that giving back
is not just an obligation,
it's a passion.
That is our family's legacy.
The Waynes and the Arkhams.
Gotham's founding families.
But what is their real legacy?
Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.
He found shocking family secrets.
How, when Martha was just a child,
her mother brutally murdered her father,
then committed suicide...
...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.
How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years
and they didn't want anyone to know.
Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.
But when the reporter refused...
...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone
and had him murdered!
The Waynes and the Arkhams,
Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.
I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.
This is your legacy too.
And Gotham needs you to answer
for the sins of your father.
Goodbye.
Do you know who I am?
You're Bruce Wayne.
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.
See?
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?
Must have made a fortune.
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?
No, boss.
$1,183.
You know why communism failed, right?
No, boss.
Austerity.
All right. All right.
Look at that. Perfect.
It's never gonna be that good again.
Hey, Johnny Slick.
What are you doing here?
Give us a moment here, fellas.
Come on.
See ya, champ.
Come on, sweetheart.
Have a seat.
I thought I might hear from you.
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...
stirring things up, huh?
- Is it true?
- What?
That reporter business?
What do you want to know here, kid?
Did you kill him? For my father?
Look, your father was in trouble.
This reporter had some dirt.
Some very...
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,
not right before the election.
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,
but he wasn't going for it.
So, he came to me.
Well, I never seen him like that.
He said, "Carmine,
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."
And when fear isn't enough...
Oof. Hmm.
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.
I handled it.
I know.
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.
But you'd be surprised
what even a good man like him
is capable of in the right situation.
Do me a favor.
Don't lose any sleep over it.
This reporter
was a lowlife.
He was on Maroni's payroll.
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.
He could never stand
your father and I had history.
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried
that your father would be in my pocket,
forever.
He would have done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor.
You understand?
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?
Do I know it for a fact?
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.
This is what you wanted, huh?
This little conversation here?
It's been a long time coming, huh?
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.
You lied to me...
my whole life.
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
He told me what he did for my father.
About Salvatore Maroni.
He told you Salvatore Maroni...
Had my father killed.
Why didn't you tell me all this?
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,
believing that he was a good man.
He was a good man.
You listen to me.
Your father was a good man.
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."
He had a man killed.
Why?
To protect his family image?
His political aspirations?
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.
He was protecting your mother.
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.
He cared about her,
and you,
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything
to finally have something on him
that he could use.
That's who Falcone is.
And that was your father's mistake.
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,
your father was distraught.
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,
that he would confess everything.
And that night,
your father and your mother were killed.
It was Falcone?
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?
I know you always blamed yourself.
You were only a boy, Bruce.
I could see the fear in your eyes,
but I didn't know how to help.
I could teach you how to fight,
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.
You needed a father.
And all you had was me.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, Alfred.
God.
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.
I thought I'd mastered all that.
I mean,
I'm not afraid to die.
I realize now there's something
I haven't got past.
This fear...
of ever going through any of that again.
Of losing somebody I care about.
Hey.
I saw the signal. That's not you?
I thought it was you.
- I found him!
- I see that.
He had my shit and my phone.
She left a message
the night they took her.
She called me...
Gordon! Help me out, man!
She got my gun!
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!
Here. Listen.
Hey! Get back here!
Where you going? Come back here!
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?
You're scaring her.
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
Please, please, please.
Please, don't hurt me, please.
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.
Now let me ask you again.
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...
Don liked to talk.
I know that.
Especially to pretty girls like you.
That's why I made him
take your passport...
until we could have
this little conversation.
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.
But first, I gotta know...
What did he tell you?
He just said
they all made a deal with you.
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?
The deal.
He said you gave some
information on some drops thing
and that's how he became mayor.
He said you were a very important man.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm. Okay.
Just take it easy.
Jesus, he's strangling her.
Take it easy.
Rata Alada.
A falcon has wings too.
Falcone is the rat?
Falcone works for you guys?
The mayor? The DA?
No.
We work for him.
Everybody does.
How?
Through Renewal.
Renewal is everything.
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.
Everybody got a piece.
But Falcone wanted more.
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.
He'd rat out his drops operation,
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,
then install them all as his puppets.
You think this goddamn election matters?
Falcone's the mayor.
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.
Come on, Vengeance.
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!
No!
We'll get him.
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!
He owns the city!
Cross that line...
you'll become just like him.
Listen to me.
Don't throw your life away.
Don't worry, honey.
I got nine of 'em.
No, don't! Hey, hey!
Oh, God!
She won't get out of there alive.
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.
I have to stop her.
Don't you mean "we"?
I gotta do this my way.
And then what?
We do what Riddler said.
Bring the rat into the light.
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.
Tell him it's about Annika.
Hey!
Look who it is, huh?
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?
Absolutely.
Alone?
Hey!
I'm just so worried.
I don't know where she is.
And I know
that you're a very important man.
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.
Mr. Falcone?
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.
I'm sorry, beautiful.
I'll be right back.
Holy shit.
That recording, provided to GC-1
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.
And we should warn you,
the contents are extremely graphic
and some of you may find it disturbing.
He just said
they all made a deal with you.
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?
The deal.
He said you gave some
information on some drops thing
and that's how he became mayor.
He said you were a very important man.
Right.
Hmm.
Okay.
Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role
as a mafia informant...
Hey, Dad.
What?
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.
You remember her?
Yeah.
Just put down the gun, honey.
This is for my mother.
I see him!
You don't think this hurts me?
My own flesh and blood, huh?
You made me do this.
Just like your mother.
He has to pay!
You don't have to pay with him.
You paid enough.
Jesus.
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?
I'm gonna start crying,
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?
Let me tell you something.
Whatever I know,
whatever I've done,
it's all going with me to my grave.
What, are you with Zorro over here?
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?
I guess we don't all work for you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.
Do you understand these rights?
Do you understand?
Yeah.
I'll see you when I walk out.
With these rights in mind,
is there anything else
you wish to tell...
Goddamn rat.
What'd you say?
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.
Probably be your last.
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?
Maybe I am.
Really, Oz?
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.
I'll spray paint your ass!
What are you doing? It wasn't me!
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!
Get your hands off of me!
"Bring him into the light.
And you'll find where I'm at."
There!
The shots came from up there!
It's Riddler.
Gage, on me.
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!
He's gone.
He's been here this whole time.
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?
Lieutenant, we got a witness here,
says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.
She said he went into the corner diner.
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.
Police! Hands up!
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.
Stay still!
Now!
Which one is you?
You tell me.
Let's go, pencil-neck.
Get that son of a bitch out of here!
...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son
have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.
Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Rel's headquarters right now...
Hey.
What are all these diaries?
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.
Got something back on one of the IDs.
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?
What about chain of evidence?
You should see this.
He's wearing gloves.
"Friday, July 16th.
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,
suffocating my mind, no escape.
But then, today, I saw it.
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.
'Renewal.'
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.
One look inside,
and finally I understood.
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.
The moment when I would learn the truth.
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."
"If you want people to understand,
really understand,
you can't just give them the answers.
You have to confront them,
torture them
with the horrifying questions,
just like they tortured me.
I know now what I must become."
Jesus.
I don't think that rat likes you, man.
This one's not a rat.
What is that?
Some kind of pry tool?
Is it a chisel?
It's a murder weapon.
He killed Mitchell with it.
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.
"My confession"?
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.
This isn't over.
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.
His final post was last night.
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.
Take some time, but we'll get in.
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.
"The Truth Unmasked."
I think I'm his last target.
You?
Maybe this is all coming to an end.
What is?
The Batman.
Yeah?
Right.
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.
You're a good cop.
I told you I'd see you in hell.
What do you want from me?
"Want"?
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.
For this moment.
I've been invisible my whole life.
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?
They'll remember me now.
They'll remember both of us.
Bruce...
Wayne.
Bruce...
Wayne.
You know, I was there that day.
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,
made all those promises.
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.
Orphan.
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.
Don't you tell me.
Do you know what being an orphan is?
It's 30 kids to a room.
Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.
And every winter one of the babies die
because it's so cold.
But, oh, no.
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.
Doesn't it?
Bruce...
Wayne.
He's the only one we didn't get.
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.
God.
Look at you.
Your mask is amazing.
I wish you could've seen me in mine.
Ain't it funny?
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.
You and I both know
I'm looking at the real you right now.
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.
No shame,
no limits.
Why did you write me?
What do you mean?
All those cards.
I told you,
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.
- We didn't do anything together.
- We did.
What did we just do?
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.
We're such a good team.
We're not a team.
I never could have
gotten him out of there.
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.
You gave me that.
I gave you nothing.
You showed me what was possible.
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.
You inspired me.
You're out of your goddamn mind.
What?
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.
How can you say that?
You think you'll be remembered?
You're a pathetic psychopath,
- begging for attention.
- No.
- You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
- No.
No, no!
A nobody!
No!
Ahhh!
This is not how this was supposed to go!
Ahhh!
I had it all planned out!
We were gonna be safe here.
We could watch the whole thing together.
Watch what?
Everything!
It was all there.
You mean, you didn't figure it out?
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.
I guess I gave you too much credit.
What have you done?
What's black and blue and dead all over?
You.
If you think you can stop
what's coming...
What have you done?
Ave Maria
What have you done?
Gratia plena
What have you done?
Maria
Gratia plena
Hey!
What are you doing in here?
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.
My uncle's a... He's an installer.
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.
It's a tucker.
Huh.
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey, guys.
Uh, thanks for all the comments
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.
Detonators?
I just want to say this will be my last
post for a little while, and, uh...
what this community has meant to me
these weeks, these months,
let's just say none of us...
is alone anymore. Okay?
Jesus.
Tomorrow's Election Day.
And Bella Rel will win.
She promised real change.
But we know the truth, don't we?
You've seen Gotham's true face now.
Together, we've unmasked it.
Its corruption, its perversion
masquerading under the guise of renewal.
But unmasking is not enough.
The day of judgment is finally upon us.
And now it is time
for retribution.
I've parked seven vans
all along the city seawall.
And on the big night,
they will go boom.
Boom!
Boom!
When the vans blow,
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.
Those who are not washed away
will race through the streets in terror.
Call Gordon.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
As breaking news
hits higher ground
in Gotham Square Garden...
...celebrations will turn to panic,
as the venue becomes
the city's shelter of last resort.
And that's where all of you come in.
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.
The pigs will have me in their custody,
but that's okay.
Because then it will be your turn.
You'll be there, waiting.
It's time for the lies to finally end.
False promises of renewal?
Change?
We'll give them real, real change now.
We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, suffering!
Wondering, "Why us?"
Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,
why them?
I can't get through! The lines are down.
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!
We got an active situation.
We need to sweep the building
for explosives
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.
Come!
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.
...we're gonna have huge problems.
The water's already started to breach.
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Rel.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.
Please! I just need your attention!
You're okay!
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?
Follow me, sir.
No, no. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's done now. It's done.
It's over.
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!
Take it easy. Easy.
Jesus.
Who the hell are you?
Me?
I'm Vengeance.
Wednesday, November 6th.
The city is underwater.
The National Guard is coming.
Martial law is in effect...
but the criminal element never sleeps.
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.
I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.
We will rebuild.
But not just our city.
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,
in our elected officials,
in each other.
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.
I'm starting to see now.
I have had an effect here...
but not the one I intended.
Vengeance won't change the past,
mine or anyone else's.
I have to become more.
People need hope.
To know someone's out there for them.
The city's angry,
scarred,
like me.
Our scars can destroy us.
Even after
the physical wounds have healed.
But if we survive them,
they can transform us.
They can give us the power
to endure...
and the strength to fight.
We are live. As you can see,
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden
helping to save the lives
of hundreds of victims.
And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,
a mysterious masked man emerges,
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...
Isn't that just terrible?
Him...
raining on your parade like that?
What is it they say?
"One day you're on top,
the next...
you're a clown."
Well,
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.
You did so well.
And you know,
Gotham loves a comeback story.
Who are you?
Well, that's the question,
isn't it?
Riddle me this...
"The less of them you have,
the more one is worth."
A friend.
You're leaving.
Jesus.
Don't you ever just say hello?
Where will you go?
I don't know. Upstate.
Bludhaven, maybe.
Why?
You asking me to stay?
You know this place
is never gonna change.
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.
There's gonna be a power grab.
It'll be bloody.
I know.
But the city can change.
It won't.
I have to try.
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.
Listen.
Why don't you come with me?
Get into some trouble.
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.
The bat and the cat.
It's got a nice ring.
Who am I kidding?
You're already spoken for.
You should go.
Selina...
Take care of yourself.

Rachel, let me see.
- Can l see?
- Finders keepers. And l found it.
ln my garden.
Finders keepers.
Bruce?
Bruce?
Mom! Mr. Alfred!
Did you have dream?
Nightmare.
Worse than this place?
They are going to fight you.
- Again?
- Until they kill you.
Can they kill me before breakfast?
You are in hell, little man.
And l am the devil.
You're not the devil.
You're practice.
Solitary.
- Why?
- For protection.
- l don't need protection.
- Protection for them.
Get in.
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?
Actually, there were seven of them.
l counted six, Mr. Wayne.
How do you know my name?
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.
Who are you?
My name is merely Ducard,
but l speak for Ra's al Ghul...
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.
A man who can offer you a path.
What makes you think l need a path?
Someone like you
is only here by choice.
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...
...but whatever
your original intentions...
...you have become truly lost.
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...
...and wishes to serve true justice.
The path of the League of Shadows.
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.
He can be destroyed or locked up.
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...
...and if they can't stop you...
...then you become
something else entirely.
Which is?
Legend, Mr. Wayne.
Tomorrow, you will be released.
lf you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.
Pick one of these flowers.
lf you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.
And what was l looking for?
Only you can know that.
You turn back. You go back.
Ra's al Ghul?
Wait.
What are you seeking?
l seek...
...the means to fight injustice.
To turn fear...
...against those
who prey on the fearful.
To manipulate the fears in others...
...you must first master your own.
Are you ready to begin?
l can... l can barely stand.
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!
Death is not considerate or fair!
And make no mistake,
here you face death.
Tiger.
Jujitsu.
Panther.
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.
And you are afraid.
But not of me.
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...
...what do you fear?
Bruce?
lt's okay. lt's okay.
You'll be okay.
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?
No, l'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.
Very good, sir.
l'm very sorry, sir. l've told...
Don't worry. lt's fine.
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?
And why do we fall?
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
Just a little fall.
lt's just a small fracture.
The bats again?
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?
All creatures feel fear.
Even the scary ones?
Especially the scary ones.
l got something to show you.
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.
l think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.
No going back to bed.
Did you build this train, Dad?
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.
And at the center...
...Wayne Tower.
Is that where you work?
- No, l work at the hospital.
l leave the running of our company
to much better men.
- Better?
- Well...
...more interested men.
Can we go?
Please.
Okay. Let's go.
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. lt was me.
l just needed some fresh air.
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?
Come on. Let's go.
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.
That's fine.
Fast.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Here you go.
lt's fine. lt's fine.
Now just take it and go.
- l said, jewelry.
Hey...
Thomas!
Bruce.
lt's okay.
Don't be afraid.
ls this your father's?
lt's okay.
Come here.
There you go.
lt's okay.
lt's okay.
Gordon.
Hey.
Good news.
We got him, son.
You're in excellent hands.
We'll be watching the empire.
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.
l thought l might prepare a little supper.
- Very well.
- Alfred?
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- lt was my fault, Alfred.
- l made them leave the theater.
- No.
- lf l hadn't gotten scared...
- lt was nothing that you did.
lt was him, and him alone.
Do you understand?
l miss them, Alfred.
l miss them so much.
So do l, Master Bruce.
So do l.
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?
My anger outweighs my guilt.
Come.
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.
l will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.
lnvisible?
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.
Always mind your surroundings.
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.
Who is he?
- He was a farmer.
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.
Your parents' death was not your fault.
lt was your father's.
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?
l've had training.
The training is nothing!
Will is everything!
The will to act.
Yield.
You haven't beaten me.
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.
Rub your chest.
Your arms will take care of themselves.
You are stronger than your father.
You didn't know my father.
But l know the rage that drives you.
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...
...poison in your veins.
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...
...so you'd be spared your pain.
l wasn't always here in the mountains.
Once, l had a wife.
My great love.
She was taken from me.
Like you, l was forced to learn
there are those without decency...
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.
Your anger gives you great power.
But if you let it, it will destroy you...
...as it almost did me.
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.
That's no help to me.
Why, Bruce?
Why could you not
avenge your parents?
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...
...or can l persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?
l'm not heading back at all.
You don't like it there?
- l like it fine.
They just don't feel the same way.
- l've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.
My room will be fine.
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.
lf l have my way, l'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
lt's not your family.
l give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...
...for what was most precious to him...
...in the whole world.
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.
Should l just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?
l wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.
Haven't given up on me yet?
Never.
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?
Old habits die hard, l guess.
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.
How's your mom?
She misses this place.
So do l.
Yeah.
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.
- l'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.
Bruce, l don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.
Someone at this proceeding...
...should stand for my parents.
We all loved your parents, Bruce.
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?
ln prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.
Rachel, this man killed my parents.
l cannot let that pass.
And l need you
to understand that, please.
Okay.
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...
...but by desperation.
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.
Mr. Chill?
Your Honor...
...not a day goes by that l don't wish
l could take back what l did.
Sure, l was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...
...but that don't change what l did.
l gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.
Has he got anything to say?
Joe! Hey, Joe!
Falcone says hi.
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.
l do.
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...
...on making the hearing public.
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.
Maybe l should thank them.
- You don't mean that.
- What if l do, Rachel?
My parents deserved justice.
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.
- lt's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.
This city is rotting.
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. lt's not.
Things are worse than ever here.
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?
- l'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?
All these years, l wanted to kill him.
Now l can't.
Your father would be ashamed of you.
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.
No gun? l'm insulted.
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- l didn't come here to thank you.
l came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.
Only those who know me, kid.
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...
...and a judge.
l wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.
Now, that's power you can't buy.
That's the power of fear.
l'm not afraid of you.
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.
But you haven't thought it through.
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!
People from your world...
...have so much to lose.
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.
You've never tasted desperate.
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.
This is a world you'll never understand.
And you always fear...
...what you don't understand.
All right.
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
l'll give you that.
More than your old man anyway.
ln the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.
He said your father begged for mercy.
Begged.
Like a dog.
Should've tipped better.
- For what?
- Your jacket.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
lt's a nice coat.
Be careful who sees you with that.
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?
Everyone.
lt's...
lt's a nice coat.
When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.
And when I traveled...
... I learned the fear before a crime...
... and the thrill of success.
But I never became one of them.
Fool. What do l care
what your name is? You're a criminal.
Tell that to the guy who owned these.
You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...
...and conquer your fears.
But a criminal is not complicated.
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.
You fear your own power.
You fear your anger...
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.
Now you must journey inwards.
You are ready.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe in your fears.
Face them.
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.
You must bask in the fear
of other men.
And men fear most
what they cannot see.
You have to become a terrible thought.
A wraith.
You have to become an idea!
Feel terror cloud your senses.
Feel its power to distort.
To control.
And know that this power
can be yours.
Embrace your worst fear.
Become one with the darkness.
Focus.
Concentrate.
Master your senses.
You cannot leave any sign.
l haven't.
lmpressive.
We have purged your fear.
You are ready to lead these men.
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.
l'm no executioner.
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.
That's why it's so important.
lt separates us from them.
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.
- This man should be tried.
By whom?
Corrupt bureaucrats?
Criminals mock society's laws.
You know this better than most.
You cannot lead these men...
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.
And where would l be leading
these men?
Gotham.
As Gotham's favored son...
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.
lt is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.
lt is one we've performed for centuries.
Gotham...
...must be destroyed.
You can't believe in this.
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.
l will go back to Gotham
and l will fight men like this...
...but l will not become an executioner.
Bruce, please.
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.
l will tell him you saved his life.
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.
- Yes, l have.
- You look very fashionable.
Apart from the mud.
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?
As long as it takes.
l want to show the people...
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.
ln the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...
...combating poverty.
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.
Did it?
ln a way.
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.
As a man...
...l'm flesh and blood,
l can be ignored, destroyed.
But as a symbol...
As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.
- l can be everlasting.
- What symbol?
Something elemental...
...something terrifying.
l assume that as you take on
the underworld...
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?
You're thinking about Rachel?
Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.
Have you told anyone l'm coming back?
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.
You had me declared dead?
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.
Well, it's a good thing
l left everything to you, then.
Quite so, sir.
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?
l would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would l?
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...
...and moved into your asylum.
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.
Or the corrupt.
Mr. Finch.
I think you should check
with Miss Dawes here...
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. lf any.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?
Looking out for you.
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?
Because as much as l care about
getting Falcone, l care more about you.
That's sweet.
We've been through all that.
Blessed bat again, sir.
They nest somewhere in the grounds.
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.
Hey, l scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.
l'm bringing in the shipments.
We are paying you for that.
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.
l am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.
But you know who l'm working for,
and when he gets here...
He... He's coming to Gotham?
Yes, he is.
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.
ldealist, huh?
Well, there's an answer to that too.
- l don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.
l think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.
Good morning.
l'm here to see Mr. Earle.
Name?
Bruce Wayne.
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.
Jessica?
Jessica? Where are you?
Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
l'm sure they'll call back.
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.
l'm sorry to disappoint.
- l need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?
- Who?
- Wayne.
lt's been all over the news.
He's back.
l'm sure you realize
l can't stop the big machine.
Too many wheels turning.
- We're going public.
- l understand.
And l'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.
l'm not looking to interfere.
- l am looking for a job.
- Oh?
l just want to get to know the company
that my family built.
Any ideas where you would start?
Applied Sciences caught my eye.
Fox's department.
l'll let him know you're coming.
You look like him. Your dad.
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.
All prototypes. None in production.
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?
What did they tell you this place was?
They didn't tell me anything.
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.
Dead end.
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.
Come on.
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.
Helped him build his train.
Here we are.
Kevlar utility harness.
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.
The 350-pound test monofilament.
Wonderful project, your dad's train.
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?
l want to borrow it.
For spelunking.
Spelunking?
Yeah, you know, cave diving?
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?
Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...
Mr. Wayne...
...the way l see it...
...all this stuff is yours anyway.
Okay. Give it a try.
Charming.
At least you'll have company.
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.
In the civil war your great grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...
...and l suspect these caverns
came in handy.
Alfred! Come up here!
l can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.
Via a dummy corporation.
lndeed. And then, quite separately...
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.
- How large?
- Say 10,000.
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.
Don't suppose you want a taste.
l just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.
l'm no rat.
ln a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?
Don't turn around.
You're a good cop.
One of the few.
What do you want?
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.
Nobody takes him down. Why?
He's paid up with the right people.
What will it take to bring him down?
Leverage on Judge Faden...
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.
Rachel Dawes.
Who are you?
Watch for my sign.
You're just one man?
Now we're two.
We?
Freeze!
What the hell was that?
Just some nut.
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.
BASE-jumping.
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?
You know, l think l have just the thing.
lt's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?
Regularly flexible...
...but put a current through it...
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.
Too expensive for the Army?
l don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?
lf you're uncomfortable...
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.
But don't think of me as an idiot.
Fair enough.
What's that?
The Tumbler?
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.
She was built as a bridging vehicle.
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!
Not... Not now, sir.
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...
...but this baby works just fine.
So, what do you think?
Does it come in black?
l need you at the docks Thursday.
- Problems?
- l don't want any trouble...
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.
- ls that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?
Have you seen the girl?
It's a cute little assistant D A.
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?
Why bats, Master Wayne?
Bats frighten me.
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.
What is this?
Continue.
Looks fine out there.
The bears go straight to the dealers.
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.
- What's the difference?
- lgnorance is bliss, my friend.
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.
Hey. Steiss.
Steiss?
What?
What the...?
l better check it.
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.
Where are you?!
Here.
Take a ride. Oh, shit.
What the hell are you?
l'm Batman.
Nice coat.
Thanks.
Hold it.
That's right, you better run.
Falcone sent them to kill you.
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.
- What's this?
- Leverage.
- For what?
- To get things moving.
Who are you?
Someone like you.
Someone who'll rattle the cages.
Ma'am? Everything okay?
Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?
We'll never tie him to it anyway.
l wouldn't be too sure of that.
What the hell is that?
Cut him down.
Unacceptable.
Now, l don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...
...get them off the street
and off the front page.
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.
lt was some asshole in a costume.
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.
Understand?
No way to bury it now.
There's still Judge Faden.
- l've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...
...we've got Falcone at the scene.
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.
Okay. Let's do it.
- Bats are nocturnal.
Bats may be.
But even for billionaire playboys,
The price for leading a double life,
l fear.
Your theatrics made an impression.
Theatricality and deception...
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.
lf those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.
Polo, for instance.
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.
These things beg the question...
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.
What does someone like me do?
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.
Buy things that are not for sale.
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...
...you might even have a little
by accident.
Sir.
- We have a situation.
- All right.
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.
It's a microwave emitter.
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it...
lt looks like somebody...
...turned it on.
lt uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.
The weapon itself is...
Missing?
Yeah.
Mr. Wayne.
Nice car.
You should see my other one.
He's done something
the police have never have.
You can't take the law
into your own hands.
Well, at least he's getting
something done.
Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.
But he's put Falcone behind bars.
Now the cops wanna bring him in.
What does that tell you?
They're jealous.
Sir, the pool is for decoration...
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.
Well, they're European.
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- lt is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...
...l'm buying this hotel...
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.
l think the Batman deserves a medal.
And a straitjacket to pin it on.
Thank you.
Bruce?
Rachel?
l'd heard you were back.
What are you doing?
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.
You were gone a long time.
- l know. How are things?
- The same.
Job's getting worse.
Can't change the world on your own.
What choice do l have...
...when you're too busy swimming?
Rachel, all of...
All this...
lt's... lt's not me. lt's...
lnside, l am...
l am more.
Come on, Bruce. Come on.
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.
Bruce...
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.
But it's not who you are underneath...
...it's what you do that defines you.
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.
Not at all. He cut his wrists?
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...
Of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore.
lt's all too much.
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.
- What do you want?
- l wanna know...
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.
About what?
You don't know anything.
l know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.
And l know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.
See, l don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.
And those goons you used.
l own the muscle in this town.
Now, l've been bringing
your stuff in for months. . .
. . .so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and l want in.
Well, l already know what he'll say.
That we should kill you.
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.
Would you like to see my mask?
l use it in my experiments.
Now, l'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.
But these crazies, they can't stand it.
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?
They scream and they cry. . .
. . .much as you're doing now.
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.
l'll talk to the judge
and see if l can get him moved. . .
. . .to the secure wing at Arkham.
l can't treat him here.
Storm's coming.
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.
lt's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.
Why? What about the other half?
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.
He'll talk to me.
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?
l think you're trying to help.
But l've been wrong before.
Come on, l ain't got all night.
Flass, l have kids to feed.
What, they don't like falafel?
Where were the other drugs going?
l never knew. l don't know.
-l swear to God.
-Swear to me!
l don't-- l don't know.
l never knew. Never.
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.
Why?
There was something--
Something else in the drugs. . .
-. . .something hidden.
-What?
l never went to the drop-off point.
lt was in the Narrows.
-Cops only go there in force.
-Do l look like a cop?
No--!
This is the one l'm talking about.
-What's your problem with it?
-lt shouldn't exist.
This ship left Singapore with
l'm guessing there's something
l'm not supposed to find in there.
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.
What the hell is this?
lt's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.
Get in here!
The other kids won't believe me.
Get rid of all traces.
Better torch the whole place.
All right.
Having trouble?
Take a seat. Have a drink.
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.
Alfred, help me.
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.
Poisonous. Poisonous.
Bruce...
... why do we fall?
-How long was l out?
-Two days.
lt's your birthday.
Many happy returns.
l've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.
lt was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.
l called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.
l analyzed your blood. . .
. . .isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.
Am l meant to understand any of that?
Not at all. l just wanted you to know
how hard it was.
-Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks. . .
. . .someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens. . . .
l'll bring what l have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.
Alfred, always a pleasure.
Lucius.
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-l have to get back.
-l just wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.
Rachel?
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-lt is my birthday.
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight.
l was just dropping off your present.
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for 2 days. . .
. . .which means l should
probably start by looking. . .
-. . .at the bottom of the river.
-Rachel.
Excuse me.
Rachel Dawes.
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.
-What's wrong?
-lt's Falcone.
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.
You're going to Arkham now?
lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.
You enjoy your party, Bruce.
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.
Happy birthday.
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.
Keep them happy until l arrive.
Tell them that joke you know.
Having fun?
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?
l need some information.
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air. . .
. . .but isn't that illegal?
l want all the information
on the development of this project. . .
. . .all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.
Did you lose one?
l'm merging your department
with Archives.
And l am firing you.
Didn't you get the memo?
Scarecrow.
Scarecrow.
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.
l have nothing to add
to the report l filed with the judge.
-l have questions about your report.
-Such as?
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness. . .
. . .to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.
-Scarecrow.
-What's ""scarecrow""?
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia. . .
. . .on an external tormentor. . .
. . .usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.
ln this case, a scarecrow.
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.
I'm a strong advocate.
Outside, he was a giant.
ln here, only the mind
can grant you power.
You enjoy the reversal.
l respect the mind's power
over the body.
lt's why l do what l do.
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.
l want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone. . .
. . .including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.
As you wish.
This way, please.
There's something
l think you should see.
This is where we make the medicine.
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.
Who knows you're here?
Who knows?
He's here.
Who?
The Batman.
What do we do?
-What anyone does. . .
. . .when a prowler comes around.
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?
At this point, they can't stop us.
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.
What about her?
She hasn't got long.
l gave her a concentrated dose.
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.
The things they say about him.
Can he really fly?
l heard he can disappear.
Well, we'll find out.
Won't we?
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?
What have you been doing here?
Who are you working for?
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?
Crane.
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.
But if you'd like to make
an appointment. . . .
Batman,
put down your weapons and surrender.
You're surrounded.
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now. . .
. . .l'll be right behind you, sir.
SWAT's on the way.
-Hey.
-Hey.
What's happened to her?
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but l can.
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs. . .
. . .and they're dumping it
into the water supply.
-What was he planning?
-l don't know.
Was he working for Falcone?
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.
I need to get her the antidote
before the damage becomes permanent.
-How long does she have?
-Not long.
What is that?
-Backup.
-What the--?
Excuse me.
How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.
l'll get my car.
l brought mine.
Yours?
l've gotta get me one of those.
He is in a vehicle.
Make and color?
lt's a black. . .
. . .tank.
Stay calm.
You've been poisoned.
l'm on him.
Breathe slowly.
Hold on.
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.
Air One to ground, block that ramp.
He's got no way off that roof.
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.
-Trust me.
Weapons system activated.
Who is this guy?
Where's he going?
He's on the roof.
What street is he taking?
-He's not on a street.
He's flying on rooftops.
At least tell me what it looks like.
Never mind.
Got him.
Coming right up on his butt.
We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading west on I- 1 7.
-Air One to ground.
-l lost him.
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.
Stealth mode activated.
Stay with me.
What--? There he is.
Just hold on.
Rachel!
They get any of this into the mains?
Yeah.
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.
How do you feel?
Where are we?
-Why did you bring me here?
-lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.
-You were poisoned.
-lt was--
-lt was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?
l don't have the luxury of friends.
l'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.
-What are they?
-The antidote.
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.
Mass production?
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham. . .
the only thing that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats. . .
. . .was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.
-lt's not.
-What would you call that?
-Damn good television.
-lt's a miracle no one was killed.
l didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.
l'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.
For Thomas Wayne, helping others. . .
. . .wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.
She's downstairs, sedated.
l need you to take her home.
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.
lt can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.
-ls Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.
We need to send these people away.
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.
l don't care about my name.
lt's not just your name, sir.
lt's your father's name.
And it's all that's left of him.
Don't destroy it.
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
Thank you.
How did the stock offering go?
Prices soared.
Who was buying?
All kinds of funds and brokerages.
lt's a bit technical.
The key thing is. . .
. . .our company's future is secure.
Great.
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.
What was the plan, Crane?
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.
Who were you working for, Crane?
Oh, it's too late.
You can't stop it now.
Here.
Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.
And thank you for that item.
You're welcome.
-l know you'll put it to good use.
-l already have.
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?
Weeks. Why?
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.
What?
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough. . .
. . .to vaporize all the water
in the mains.
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
Misplaced?
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.
My security clearance
has been revoked.
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
now would it?
l suppose not.
-Bruce, there's somebody here you
must meet-Not now, Mrs. Delane.
-Bruce, there's somebody here you
must meet-Not now, Mrs. Delane.
Now, am l pronouncing this right. . .
. . .Mr. Ra's al Ghul?
You're not Ra's al Ghul.
l watched him die.
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
Are his methods supernatural?
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham. . .
. . .wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.
l saved your life.
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.
Your quarrel is with me.
You let these people go.
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.
Everyone.
Everybody?
l. . . .
l want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.
No, really.
There's a thing about being a Wayne. . .
. . .that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves. . .
. . .to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.
-That's enough, Bruce.
-l'm not finished.
To all of you. . . .
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends. . .
. . .you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me. . .
. . .please, leave me in peace.
Please go.
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.
The party's over, get out.
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.
Amusing.
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.
So Crane was working for you.
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.
He was able to weaponize it.
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have ""lives,"" Wayne.
Crime. Despair.
This is not how man
was supposed to live.
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption. . .
. . .for thousands of years.
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
Burned London to the ground.
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence. . .
. . .we return to restore the balance.
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
Give me more time.
There are good people here.
You're defending a city so corrupt. . .
. . .we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.
Time to play.
When l found you in that jail,
you were lost.
But l believed in you.
l took away your fear,
and l showed you a path.
You were my greatest student.
lt should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.
l'll be standing where l belong.
Between you
and the people of Gotham.
No one can save Gotham.
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens. . .
. . .such as your parents.
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself. . .
. . .and Gotham has limped on
ever since.
We are back to finish the job.
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.
lf someone stands in the way
of true justice. . .
. . .you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.
-l am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn. . .
. . .to mind your surroundings.
Justice is balance.
You burned my house
and left me for dead.
Consider us even.
No one comes out. Make sure.
They're all gone?
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.
Serial killers, rapists.
Get them to raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges. . .
. . .when l get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs. . .
-. . .that are running loose out there.
-Come on!
l hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?
What have l done, Alfred?
Everything my family. . .
. . .my father, built. . . .
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.
l wanted to save Gotham.
l failed.
Why do we fall, sir?
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.
You still haven't given up on me?
Never.
Harassment! l see harassment!
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?
Madman with a gun.
With residents furious...
...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates....
We're about to raise these bridges.
Officer, l am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!
Hold these people back.
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.
Hopefully you won't need it.
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.
All right, last one across.
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!
l can't find my mom.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Gentlemen. . .
. . .time to spread the word.
And the word is. . .
. . .panic.
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.
Right there.
That water main
is right under the Narrows.
lt's okay.
This is Commissioner Loeb.
Come on, somebody talk to me.
Come on!
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.
What the hell is going on?
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!
Well, they're completely incapacitated!
lt's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.
Of course they are!
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.
Gordon. . .
. . .there's nobody left to send in.
So l'm on my own?
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.
This is just the beginning.
lf they hit the whole city with toxin
. . .there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart from mass panic.
-How are they gonna do that?
-They 'll be using the train.
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.
If they get their machine
into Wayne's station...
it'll cause a chain reaction that'll
vaporize the entire city's water supply.
Covering Gotham in this poison.
l'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but l may need your help.
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?
There you are!
There is nothing to fear. . .
. . .but fear itself!
l am here to help you!
Batman will save us. He'll come.
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.
l told you he'd come.
Wait.
You could die.
At least tell me your name.
lt's not who l am underneath. . .
. . .but what l do that defines me.
Bruce?
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.
-lt ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have a city to destroy.
-l can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.
GPS online.
In 100 yards.
Gentlemen.
Who the hell authorized this?
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing all our pipes.
and if that pressure reaches us. . .
. . .the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!
At the next intersection, turn right.
You will never learn.
Sorry.
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.
Evacuate the building.
We're right on top of the
main hub and it's gonna blow.
Weapons system activated.
Nice ride.
Armed.
Don't be afraid, Bruce.
Come on. Come on.
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.
Who said anything about stopping it?
Yes!
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!
You finally learned to do
what is necessary?
l won't kill you. . .
. . .but l don't have to save you.
The meeting is already started.
-What meeting?
Fox, l seem to remember firing you.
You did.
l got another job.
Yours.
On whose authority?
Batman may
have made the front page. . .
. . .but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.
Bruce Wayne.
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?
-The fact that l'm the owner.
What are you talking about?
The company went public a week ago.
And l bought most of the shares.
Through various charitable
foundations and trusts and so forth.
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing. . .
...is that my company's future
is secure.
Right, Mr. Fox?
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.
Didn't you get the memo?
-l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce. . .
. . .l'm sorry.
The day that Chill died, l. . . .
l said terrible things.
But true things.
l was a coward with a gun. . .
. . .and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.
l never stopped thinking about you.
About us.
And when l heard you were back, l. . . .
l started to hope.
But then l found out about your mask.
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.
No. This. . .
. . .is your mask.
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.
The man l loved. . .
. . .the man who vanished. . .
. . .he never came back at all.
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.
Maybe someday,when
Gotham no longer needs Batman. . .
. . .l'll see him again.
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?
Your father would be very proud of you.
Just like me.
What will you do?
Rebuild it.
Just the way it was, brick for brick.
Just the way it was, sir?
Yeah, why?
l thought this might be
a good opportunity for. . .
. . .improving the foundations.
-ln the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.
-Nice.
-l couldn't find any mob bosses.
Well, sergeant?
-lt's ""lieutenant"" now.
You really started something.
Bent cops running scared.
Hope on the streets.
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
We will.
We can bring Gotham back.
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask. . .
. . .and jumping off rooftops.
Now, take this guy.
Armed robbery, double homicide.
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
Leaves a calling card.
l'll look into it.
l never said thank you.
And you'll never have to.
This has been
a long time coming, fellas.
Three years on the plates alone.
But you'll find the product
worth the wait.
Go ahead. Take a good look, boys.
Jeez, Mr. Sol, I can't tell
the difference.
You'd need a neutron microscope.
Identical, to Ben Franklin's stubble.
I want half a mil a week laundered in
the casino. 3/4 mil by March.
Anybody got a problem with that?
The Bat!
Get him!
Chuckie Sol.
Batman!
How'd you get here?
Your Angel of Death awaits.
You ain't the Bat!
Who are you? What do you want?
I want you, Chuckie-boy.
This time I got you,
you lousy, stinking...
What...?!
- Look!
- Good Lord!
- What happened?
- Hey, look! It's Batman!
I'm telling you, it's vigilantism
at its deadliest.
How many times are we gonna let
Batman cross the line?
Councilman, you can't blame Batman
for what happened to Chuckie Sol.
Why not?
He's a loose cannon, commissioner.
It's not just my opinion. A lot of
people, including the police...
...think Batman's as unstable
as the crooks.
What kind of city are we running...
... - when we depend on the support
of a potential madman?!
Such rot, sir. Why, you're
the very model of sanity.
By the way, I pressed your tights and
put away your exploding gas balls.
Thank you, Alfred.
Might one inquire what this is?
A piece of windshield
from Chuckie Sol's car.
There's a chemical residue on it.
A dense, long-chain macromolecular
polymer. Adaptogenic, of course.
Of course.
I should be landing any minute.
- It'll be good to see you again.
- You too-
And don't worry about a thing. We'll
clear up these old family finances.
Don't forget...
...you've got a bigtime councilman
on your side.
I can't believe it's been 10 years.
Thinking of looking up some old friends?
Arthur, don't start that again.
He's ancient history.
That's encouraging. I'll see you soon.
Oh, come on, Bruce! All alone
in this big mansion...
Haven't you ever thought about marriage,
even once?
Never say the "M" word in front of
Bruce. It makes him nervous.
What about the "l" word?
The "l" word?
"Ingagement."
I'd watch out for Brucie
if I were you, girls.
He makes you think you're the only woman
he's ever been interested in.
And just when you're wondering where to
register the china...
...he forgets your phone number.
That's Bruce Wayne's style.
Bruce?
Excuse me.
Friend in need?
Councilman.
So how goes the Bat bashing?
Better than your love life.
You seem to pick them knowing there's no
chance for a serious relationship.
Since that one girl. What was her name?
Anne? Andi? Andrea?
Yes, Andrea Beaumont!
There was a sweet number.
How'd you let her get loose?
Thanks for the handkerchief, Arthur.
You know where you can stick it.
Andrea...
If Daddy gets any more protective,
he'll build a moat around my bedroom.
Times like this
I wish you were around to...
Excuse me. I thought you were
saying something. To me, I mean.
Know who that was?
Bruce Wayne. You know,
Wayne Enterprises?
I've seen him on campus. Very moody.
Cute, though.
- Yes?
- I heard my name. I thought...
- Who are you talking to?
- My mother.
Oh. I didn't mean to...
That's okay. We're done.
Mom doesn't have much to say today.
I'm not the only one
who talks to their loved ones.
I didn't say anything.
When I talk to her out loud,
I can imagine how she'd reply.
I can hear her, like she's right there.
I talked to my parents.
What did you say?
- I made a vow.
- What vow?
A secret one.
A man of mystery!
Have you kept your vow?
So far.
Andrea Beaumont.
Bruce Wayne.
I know. "The boy billionaire."
With all that money, why do you always
look like you want to jump off a cliff?
- Why should you care?
- I don't.
Mother was asking.
Let's step on it!
We ain't got all night.
Wait for me!
Coming through.
Okay, Skaz. We're done shopping.
All clear here.
Well, Bruce, here goes.
Let's blow this pop stand.
On your stomachs, arms spread!
Who's this clown?
You heard me!
Yeah, you heard him, boys.
You heard Mr. Kung Fu.
- I'm shaking.
- Say your prayers, sucker!
Yes...!
Excuse me.
Hey, Jonesey!
There!
I read about your anonymous exploits,
and I must say...
...are you sure you won't
reconsider rugby?
Sorry, Alfred, but the plan is working.
I had the edge. I could feel it!
There was only one thing wrong.
They weren't afraid of me.
I've got to strike fear in them.
Pardon, Master Bruce. We may want
to postpone the shoptalk.
I believe you have a visitor.
Hi! Hey, what happened to you?
Trip over some loose cash?
It's been 3 days since we met, and still
no calls. I figured you must be dead.
You expect every guy you meet
to call you?
The ones that are smart enough
to dial a phone.
- What is that?
- Jujitsu.
Gesundheit.
That was a joke.
Jujitsu is no joke.
It takes years to master.
Got a few moves of my own.
Miss Hovey's self-defense class
for girls.
Oh, he laughs!
Nice footwork. Can you dance too?
Pardon, sir, but Miss Bambi
is dancing on the piano.
Brucie! Where are you?
You guys wait here.
Whatever you say, Mr. Bronski.
They say the Bat iced this guy.
I know.
Chuckie, Chuckie...
You always were a loser.
Buzz...
Who's there?
Buzz Bronski.
Your Angel of Death awaits.
Get away, you freak!
Time to pay for your sins, Mr. Bronski.
All right, creep. Catch this!
What the...?
Jake! Dougan!
Boys!
Come on!
He was up here!
Boss! Boss!
Boys! Hurry!
You always were a loser, Mr. Bronski.
Farewell, Mr. Bronski!
Oh, man!
It's the Bat!
It's the stinking Bat!
Buzz!
What do you mean?
You have to go after him!
He didn't do it!
It's garbage, Mr. Reeves.
Batman does not kill. Period!
You want him, you get him.
I'll have no part of it.
Well, gentlemen?
Any ideas?
He's usually here by now.
There appears to be some chemical
residue on the lawn.
Could match the traces on the glass.
Not much,
but it's been that kind of day.
You'd think they could afford
a weed-eater.
Sorry, Mom, but the whole world's
going to seed.
You!
Bruce?
I'm having the banker cut through some
red tape. He can roll your money into...
...a higher-yield account.
Amount? What amount?
I said "account."
I'm sorry, I was just... reminiscing.
That's okay.
You must have a lot on your mind.
Monsieur?
Remember this place?
Sure. You, me and Daddy used to come
here all the time.
How is the old guy?
You're still close, aren't you?
Closer than ever.
I'm sorry he couldn't
make it into town, but...
...l've always wished I could have
some time alone with you.
Well, who knows what the future
might bring?
Welcome to the Gotham World's Fair,
a dream of the future-
A bright tomorrow filled with hope
and promise for all mankind-
This is a vision
of the shimmering utopia... -
... - where we shall all spend
the rest of our lives-
Do you think we'll really see
any of this in our lifetime?
Bruce, I'm talking to you.
Oh! I'm sorry, Andi.
- My mind was on something else.
- What?
Oh, just, you know...
The future!
Anyone's in particular,
or just the generic brand?
You know.
No, I don't. Since when
do you talk to me about your plans?
By the way...
...Dad's been wanting to meet you.
- Oh, yeah?
I told him you're not up to it yet.
I can meet him.
Great!
I'll call him right now.
You sure about this?
Sure, I'm sure.
What am I doing?
This isn't part of the plan.
I must be going nuts.
If I may make so bold, Master Bruce,
I'd say quite the reverse.
Mr. Beaumont,
here are the partnership papers.
If you could just go over them...
IKnock, knock!
This is a most pleasant interruption!
At last I meet the elusive Bruce Wayne.
Nice to meet you, sir.
"Sir"? Don't be so formal, Bruce.
She's said so much about you,
I feel we're practically family.
Daddy...
Don't mind me. I was just leaving.
I'm sorry.
Arthur Reeves, one of the hot Young
Turks from my legal department.
You should get to know him.
I hope we're not interrupting.
Not at all! I'm never too busy
for my Andi and her friends.
I tell you, Bruce, I do
a lot of financial planning.
In money matters, you can't
take the future for granted.
But money means little without
loved ones to share it with.
Nothing's more important than family.
Yes, Mr. Beaumont.
- Carl.
- Excuse me, sir...
...a Mr. Valestra is here to see you.
He says he has an appointment...
If he says he has an appointment...
...then he has an appointment.
That's what I like about your pop,
kiddo.
He knows his priorities.
Is my shirt too big,
or is that my flesh crawling?
Mr. Valestra is not what you'd call
a "people person."
No kidding!
That's just Daddy's business.
He deals with everyone.
It's not your father, Andi, it's...
...it's everything!
I said hand over the cashbox, man!
Give me!
- Pops here needs some persuasion.
- Don't hurt me!
- Stay here! I gotta stop this.
- Bruce, don't.
What should I do? Just stand here?
Just come back to me in one piece,
please?
Better have your
insurance paid up, sucker!
Come on! Pick up the box!
Pick up the box!
Thank God you're all right.
I was so frightened!
Let me have a look at you.
Andrea, please!
What am I still doing this for?
It's gotta be one or the other.
I can't have it both ways.
I can't put myself on the line
if someone's waiting for me at home.
Miss Beaumont would be glad to know
you feel that way.
She's holding on line one, sir.
Master Bruce?
Alfred, I can't. Not now.
What shall I say, sir?
I don't know.
I just don't know!
It doesn't mean I don't care anymore.
I don't want to let you down, honest.
But it just doesn't hurt
so bad anymore.
You can understand, can't you?
I can give money to the city
to hire more cops.
Let others take the risk.
It's different now!
Please. I need it to be different now.
I know I made a promise.
But I didn't see this coming!
I didn't count on being happy.
Please...
...tell me that it's okay.
Maybe they already have.
Maybe they sent me.
Get in.
All I want to know is, is it true?
Is the Batman really hitting our people?
We have eyewitnesses.
Beautiful.
That's just beautiful. Why?
He never leaned on us before.
I'm too old for this.
You could demand police protection.
What are you, a comedian?
This is the Batman we're talking about.
A freak job!
He'll crucify me!
Pull over.
It's not very healthy in here.
"O'Neil Funding Corporation."
"Adam's Tool and Die."
I should've known.
Sir?
Chuckie Sol and Buzz Bronski.
They have a history as partners
in dummy corporations...
...set up over 10 years ago.
The third director
was one Salvatore Valestra.
Sal's having company tonight.
Don't wait up.
Meaning, I trust that once you're done
with him, you'll be seeing her?
You think you know everything about me,
don't you?
I diapered your bottom.
I bloody well ought to... sir!
Well, you're wrong!
Andrea's father...?
You know how I've always
wanted to see Europe.
Dad has business there. It's a hush-
hush deal. He won't tell me a thing.
Not even when we'd be coming back.
Will you at least let me try
to talk you out of it?
Wait, please.
Never mind.
I'm no good at this.
Here. You'll get the idea.
What do you say?
Of course I will!
I never thought this would happen.
I always felt like I'd
thrown you a curve ball.
Like you never knew what to do with me,
since I wasn't in the plan.
You are now. I'm changing the plan.
Looks like Dad's got company.
Business-type company.
He doesn't usually see clients here.
Not at this hour.
Maybe we should wait
to tell him the good news.
- Maybe.
- Good night, Bruce.
- Alfred.
- Miss.
It's another cave, all right.
As big as the house, judging from
all the bats that came out of it.
Alfred, what's wrong?
This just arrived, sir.
"Left with Dad.
Too young...
...need time.
Forget about me."
My God!
If there was just some other way...
I hate that song.
Gasp!
Can it be?
Old Sallie "The Wheezer" Valestra.
Welcome, paisan!
It's been a dog's age.
Hello, Joker.
Didn't mean to drop by unannounced.
Oh, Salvatore!
Why so formal?
Mi casa nostra es su casa nostra-
What does an old-timer like you
want with a two-timer like me?
Business.
Oh, business!
Sounds like fun! Come!
We'll repair to more
comfortable environs.
Now hold on to your hat,
and watch those valuables.
It's going to be a bumpy ride!
Honey, I'm home!
Don't mind my home-security system.
Down, Rusty.
Can't be too careful,
with all those weirdos around.
What? Meat loaf again?
Oh, I had it for lunch!
Isn't Hazel here a cutie?
True, she's a real homebody, but you
can't help who you fall in love with.
Come. Have a seat, Sal.
Tell me what's on your so-called mind.
It's Batman.
He's gone nuts!
First he whacked Chuckie Sol...
...then Buzz.
Now he's after me.
I've been reading lately how old
guano-man is wound tight enough to snap.
Wouldn't it be great if I'd finally
driven him off the deep end?
This isn't a joke!
He's knocking us off, and
only you can take him down.
Five million up front, with
whatever you want to finish him off.
What do I look like? Pest control?
Think, you fool! Once he gets me,
how long till he gets you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Your hands are just as dirty.
Dirtier!
Don't touch me, old man!
I don't know where you've been!
Oh, Sal, no one could
take a joke like you.
- Of course I'll help you out.
- Really?
Certainement-
No way is anybody
gonna hurt my pal Sal.
That's it!
That's what I want to see.
A nice, big smile.
- Thanks for another lovely dinner.
- My pleasure.
You know, it's not good to go to bed
on a full stomach.
We could stay up...
...talk for a while.
I've got a killer day tomorrow, Artie.
But call me, okay?
Good night.
So we meet again. I like the cape.
I'm not sure about the mask though.
Have you ever seen this?
But that's your father.
He set up their corporate partnership.
So? That's his job.
He's the one element
that tied these gangsters together.
- Where's your father now?
- Haven't a clue.
Why don't you try Madagascar?
That's not what you told Reeves.
You said you were closer than ever
to your father.
You had me bugged?
I can read lips.
Then read them now. Get out.
Still following your Dad's orders?
The way I see it, the only one in this
room controlled by his parents is you.
Sal Valestra...
...your Angel of Death awaits.
Guess the joke is on me!
You're not Batman after a//-
Looks like there's a new face
in Gotham... -
... - and soon his name
will be all over town-
To say nothing of his legs,
feet, spleen... -
... - and head!
Stay away! This is not your fight!
This madness ends now!
Batman, this is the police-
You are under arrest-
Step away from the edge of the roof-
Put your hands on top of your head
and stay in the light-
Stay on him!
This is 6-30 in pursuit-
Subject moving north along Denny Drive-
All units approach with caution-
Subject is armed and dangerous-
Use of deadly force is authorized-
Take it down! I gotta get closer!
Freeze!
He's heading for the
construction site!
SWAT deployment teams, move
into position- All units acknowledge-
Roger that- Moving into position-
All available units to 4th and Madison,
the construction site-
Charlie-three, prepare for tear gas-
There he is, men!
Hey, wait!
You jerk!
Get a light up there!
Delta-three to ground-
He's down- We have him!
Fire!
Quick, around the back!
Come on, you grunts!
Hurry!
Who's that?
There are certain advantages
to having a sturdy cranium.
But then, hardheadedness
was always your virtue.
Well, I'm sure I have things
to do elsewhere.
You have an excellent sense of timing.
It was all over TV.
I had to do something.
I'm grateful, of course.
But I need to know why you won't
tell me the truth about your father.
I suppose the "world's greatest
detective" will find out eventually.
You remember Daddy was having a meeting
that night with his partners...
You're a liar and a cheat, Carl.
You've taken what's ours.
- You're gonna pay one way or another.
- No! Please!
Daddy! What's going on?
I'm sorry you had to see this,
Miss Beaumont.
Let her go!
Watch it, Carl!
Please, Sal, give me one more day.
I swear I'll get the money.
Convince me.
This time tomorrow.
On my mother's grave.
As soon as the European banks open,
I'll have it wired to you.
Twenty-four hours.
This time tomorrow
we'll have the money...
...or I'll have your heart
in my hand.
Let's go, boys.
Are you all right?
Pack a suitcase.
We've got to get to the airport, now!
But you said you'd have the money.
It's not that simple.
It's tied up in investments.
- It could take weeks.
- But I can't leave!
Bruce proposed.
We're getting married.
Listen to me.
I just used up the last shred
of pity Sal Valestra has.
If I don't pay him within 24 hours,
they'll kill us both!
Why did you do this? Why did you
get involved with these people?
I'm sorry, Andi.
I just wanted a chance for you.
I'll get you out of this.
We'll be free of those guys.
Whatever it takes.
That's a promise.
From that night, we were on the run-
We hid all over Europe, eventually
settled on the Mediterranean coast-
Dad was able to parlay the money
he embezzled into a fortune-
Finally, he thought he had enough
to pay them back.
It would never be enough.
They wanted interest compounded
in blood. He had to find another way.
The man in the costume...
Your father?
He said he'd get them. Somehow.
When I heard about Chuckie Sol...
...I had to come back...
...to find him, to stop him.
I'm sorry, Bruce.
That's twice now I've come
into your life and screwed it up.
Can we make it work this time?
I want to say yes...
...but you know it'll come down
between me and your father.
Daddy doesn't matter anymore.
I'll see you tonight.
I'll be here.
It's so good to see you
and Miss Beaumont together again.
Might one ask what this bodes
for your alter ego?
I'm not sure, Alfred.
Everything's happening so fast.
So much has changed.
You still love each other.
That's true.
I love her.
Maybe after this is settled...
Maybe then...
I'm sure they'd have
wanted you to be happy.
Is something wrong?
Maybe.
You're saying there were 4 precincts on
Batman's heels, and he still got away?
Unbelievable!
Tsk, tsk.
And to think our tax money
goes to pay those jerks.
You!
That's right, Artie. Bring in the
press, why don't you? What a photo-op.
The Councilman and his wacky pal!
You're no friend of mine.
Oh, Artie, I'm crushed!
How the high and mighty forget!
Don't you remember?
You, me...
...Sallie and the gang?
What are you talking about?
I never met them or you.
I worked for Beaumont.
I didn't know what he was doing.
But you knew about it afterwards.
And put it to good use, eh?
What do you want?
To find out who has iced the old gang.
Haven't you read the papers?
It's Batman!
Wrong! It ain't the Bat.
Nope, I've seen the guy.
He looks more like
the Ghost of Christmas Future.
Nowhere near as cute as Batboy.
You say it's someone else?
Someone who wouldn't mind seeing
our old pals out of the way.
Maybe...
...gulp... sob...
...me too!
That's when I thought
about you, Arturo.
An important, upstanding guy like you
could find it awkward...
...if certain secrets were
revealed about his past.
Wait. You're not saying that l...
Mr- Reeves, Miss Beaumont
on the line-
Beaumont? Not the babe!
Oh, you devil!
Arthur, are you there?
Hello, Andrea.
We're still on for lunch, right?
I'm sorry, I can't. I got hung up.
I'll explain everything tonight.
All right.
I'll see you then.
Now, ain't that a co-inky-dink?
We're talking about the old man...
...and the spawn of his loins
just happens to call.
Makes you want to laugh, doesn't it?
Good heavens!
Councilman, please.
You've got to control yourself.
I'm trying, for God's sake!
Here's the relaxant, doctor.
I need some help.
IKeep him still!
Councilman, please!
That's it.
That's right...
That should relax you enough
for the toxin to run its course.
Try to stay calm.
Oh, no!
Why did the Joker meet with you?
Is it about
the gangster murders?
He thinks you're involved. Why?!
I don't know.
That's not the answer I want.
Beaumont needed me to help him
and his kid get out of town.
He kept in touch.
When did you last speak?
Years ago.
My first election campaign.
I was running out of money
and asked Beaumont for help.
He said no!
So you sold him to the Mob.
I was broke, desperate!
They said all they wanted
was their money back.
Councilman.
Councilman, please!
Hello, anybody home?
Listen, boopsie, even though
you never call and never write...
...I still got a soft spot for you.
So I'm sending you a fun gift.
Airmail.
And there's no use jumping
out the window this time, toots-
The plane of the future
is going to make you history-
Hello? Hello, operator?
I believe my party's been... -
... - disconnected!
You!
But he paid you!
Dad?!
Well, Haze, guess it's
time to call it a night.
What do you say, hon?
Feeling the old electricity tonight?
Ain't it always the way? You get
in the mood and company shows up.
Joker...
...your Angel of Death awaits.
I'm impressed, lady.
You're harder to kill
than a cockroach on steroids.
So, you figured it out?
Gotta hand it to you. Nice scheme!
Costume's a bit theatrical,
but hey, who am I to talk?
Very cute...
...but I can blow smoke too, toots!
Nice trick, sweetheart.
You could teach old Batsy
a thing or two about disappearing.
You're not smiling, Joker.
I thought you found death amusing.
Me? Oh, no.
You won't hear a giggle out of me.
Made you look!
Well, if it isn't Smokey the Babe!
Just in time to meet her biggest fan!
How about a little pick-me-up?
Your father's dead, isn't he?
You came into town early
to get Chuckie Sol...
...so you could shift the blame
to your father.
They took everything, Bruce.
My dad, my life...
...you.
I'm not saying it's right, or even
sane, but it's all I've got left.
So either help me
or get out of the way!
You know I can't do that.
Look at what they did to us...
...what we could have had!
They had to pay.
But Andi, what will vengeance solve?
If anyone knows the answer
to that, Bruce...
...it's you.
Leave, Andi.
Now.
Please.
Oh, Batsy!
Yoo-hoo!
You're too late, Batman!
There are 20 miles of tunnels
under this place.
And they're all filled
with explosives.
In five minutes, everything goes up!
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?
What are you doing?
You're crazy! I'm your only chance
to get out of here!
Let me go or we'll both die!
Whatever it takes!
For once...
...l'm stuck without a punch line.
Okay...
...I give up.
I surrendered already.
Tell her, Batman.
You've got to get out of here.
The place is wired to explode!
No. One way or another,
it ends tonight.
Goodbye, my love.
I couldn't save her, Alfred.
I don't think she wanted to be saved.
Vengeance blackens the soul, Bruce.
I always feared you would become
that which you fought against.
You walk the edge of that abyss
every night, but you haven't fallen in.
And I thank heaven for that.
But Andrea fell into
that pit years ago.
No one, not even you,
could have pulled her back.
What is it?
Quite a sight.
I'm sorry...
...do you want to be alone?
I am.

- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!
May I have your attention, Gotham City?
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.
How about that?
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!
Read about it!
Missing link between man and bird.
My dear boy...
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.
Usually, it's a waste of time.
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!
Well, here's hoping.
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...
...mentioning the new power plant.
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.
Power plant?
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.
Your analysts foresee growth
at 1% per annum. That's a mild swelling.
Imagine...
...a Gotham City...
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...
...but blinking on and off...
...embarrassingly low on juice.
Frankly...
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...
...through the usual channels.
I have a suggestion.
Well...
...actually, really, just more like a question.
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.
In the plus column, though...
...she makes great coffee.
Dad.
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.
"Actually, more of a question."
You stupid corn dog.
Corn dog, corn dog.
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...
...happy holidays.
We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.
Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...
Darn!
I forgot my speech.
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.
Santa Claus?
Afraid not.
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.
Sue me...
...if I want to give some back.
I only wish I could hand out more
than just...
...expensive baubles.
I wish I could hand out world peace...
...and unconditional love...
...wrapped in a big bow.
Oh, but you can.
Oh, but you will.
Merry Christmas.
Great idea.
Not mine.
What are you waiting for? The signal!
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!
What do you want?
Not you!
Shreck!
You'll have to go through me.
Dad, go! Save yourself!
Dad, go!
Shut up!
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...
You missed.
The Batman.
Or is it just "Batman"?
Your choice, of course.
Well, that was...
...very brief.
Just like all the men in my life.
What men?
Well...
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.
We'll see.
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?
I believe the word you're looking for is...
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.
You're at home in bed...
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...
...in a lifetime of profiteering.
Tragic irony...
...or poetic justice?
You tell me.
My God, it's true.
Penguin Man of the sewer.
Odd as it may seem, Max...
...you and I have something in common:
We're both perceived as monsters.
But somehow...
...you're a well-respected monster...
...and I am, to date...
...not!
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.
Tough, yes.
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!
I know all about you.
What you hide, I discover.
What you put in your toilet...
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
It's not working.
Oh, you big baby!
Just blanks.
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?
No, Max.
I have an entirely other purpose.
I'm ready, Max.
I've been down here too long.
It's time for me to ascend...
...to re-emerge...
...with your help...
...your know-how...
...your savvy.
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.
I come from...
...like you.
And, like you, I want some respect!
A recognition of my basic humanity.
But most of all...
...I want to find out who I am...
...by finding my parents...
...learning my human name.
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!
And...
...exactly why am I going to help you?
Well...
Let's start.
Let's see what we have in here.
A batch of toxic waste...
...from your clean textile plant!
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!
It could have come from anywhere.
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?
If there were such documents...
...that's not an admission...
...they would've been shredded.
Good idea.
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.
By the way...
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?
Fred?
Fred's actually...
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.
Good.
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!
Want to greet any other body parts?
Remember, Max...
...you flush it, I flaunt it.
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?
I think, perhaps...
...I could help orchestrate
a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
Miss Kitty.
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?
Not that I'd ever pry.
Drink your dinner.
What?
How can anyone be so pathetic?
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.
Yeah, but...
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.
I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...
...as some lowly secretary.
Lowly assistant.
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.
Some appendage!
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.
Hello...
...Selina Kyle.
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.
It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.
This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...
...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!
Working late?
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...
How industrious!
How did you open the protected files?
May I ask?
I figured your password was "Geraldo,"
your Chihuahua, and it was.
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...
...about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...
...big, giant... capacitor.
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...
...Gotham City...
...and storing it...
...stockpiling it...
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.
Who'd you say this to?
Nobody.
What did curiosity do to the cat?
I'm no cat.
I'm just an assistant.
A secretary.
And a very good one.
Too good?
Listen...
...it's our secret. Honest.
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?
This power plant...
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.
For Chip.
Nothing must prevent that.
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.
It's not like you can kill me!
Actually, it's a lot like that.
For a second, you really frightened me.
Really?
Honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?
Hello, Selina Kyle.
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.
One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...
...so much yummier.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.
It's got to stop.
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...
...in a season when
it should be coming together.
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...
...and should be a healing time.
I say that not only as an official...
...but as a husband and a father.
Last night's violence won't happen again.
I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, "Thanks. "
It's the hideous Penguin Man.
Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...
...and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...
...is a chance...
...to find my mom and dad.
A chance to find out who they are...
...and thusly...
...who I am.
And then...
...with my parents...
...try to understand... why.
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...
...to a child...
...who was born...
...a little different.
A child...
...who spent his first Christmas...
...and many since...
...in a sewer.
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?
His parents.
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.
I hope he finds them.
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.
How about a statement?
People want to know.
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!
Wait a minute.
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...
...with dignity and privacy?
Is the Penguin a personal friend?
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.
"Circus returns for a two-week...
"Kids will love..."
Thanks.
It's cold!
It's vichyssoise.
It's supposed to be cold.
"Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...
"...featuring a poodle lady...
"...the world's fattest man...
"...and Aquatic Bird Boy."
Why are you determined to prove...
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...
"...after reports of missing children
in several towns.
"Police have closed down
the Red Triangle fairgrounds.
"However, at least one
freak-show performer vanished before...
"...he could be questioned."
I suppose you feel better now.
No.
Actually, I feel worse.
Why're you still out?
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?
I think he knows who his parents are.
There's something else.
Mr. Penguin...
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!
I am a man!
I have a name!
Oswald Cobblepot!
You'll never be able to settle with them?
True.
I was their "Number-One" son...
...and they treated me like number two.
But it's human nature to fear...
...the unusual.
Perhaps...
...when I held my...
...Tiffany baby rattle...
...with a shiny flipper...
...instead of five chubby digits...
...they freaked.
But I forgive them.
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!
"'Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall."'
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.
Now, now, pretty little thing.
Nice and easy.
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.
Be gentle, it's my first time.
Tic-tac-toe.
You make it easy, don't you?
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.
I am Catwoman...
...hear me roar.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.
I'm not sure I like the inference.
I didn't realize I made one.
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.
A million saved is a million earned.
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.
My question is:
What's your angle?
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.
Mayors come and go.
Blue bloods tire easily.
Can you go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?
I guess we'll find out.
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon."
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out...
Anywhere he wants.
Preferably some nightspot grotto...
...or...
...secluded hideaway.
Nice suit.
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.
This is Bruce...
...Wayne.
We've met.
Have we?
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.
You mean, "mistook me."
Isn't that what I said?
I don't think so.
What happened?
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?
It's a blur.
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...
...and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.
And the time I forgot to wear
my underpants to school...
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.
He's dead now.
But last night...
...complete blur.
Couldn't you just die?
Please...
...show out Mr. Wayne.
With pleasure.
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Shreck.
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.
Well, that's a...
...long story.
I could free up some time.
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.
I'm working.
I'm leaving.
You buy that blurry business?
Women.
Nothing surprises me...
...except your late mother.
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?
Bottom line?
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.
Meantime...
...l've got badder fish to fry.
Oswald...
...it's Max.
You're home?
How've you been?
Your extended family?
Good to have a family.
I'd rather not be disturbed now.
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.
I don't like surprises.
Come on.
Don't peek.
You'll spoil it.
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.
Mayor?
Mayor.
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.
Don't worry.
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.
Here.
Reclaim your birthright.
I'm Jen.
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.
So if we were to just lose this...
We'll do it another time.
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer, huh?
Still, it could be worse.
My nose could be gushing blood.
What do you mean by that?
Everybody, back to work!
Let's make...
...a mayor!
You're right, we missed
the regular election...
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.
Then think of you...
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.
I'd like to fill her void.
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.
A platform?
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot."
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now! "
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen."
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...
You want my old friends up there...
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.
But...
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.
I have my own things to tend to.
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...
...that your parents carelessly discarded.
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...
...access to the captains of industry...
...unlimited poontang.
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.
All right, I'll be mayor.
Burn, baby, burn!
- Who is she?
- What is she?
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.
You poor guys.
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.
You're overpaid. Hit the road.
Go ahead and hit me.
Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene.
Gravely assessing the devastation.
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.
You're not the mayor.
Things change.
What do you want?
The direct approach.
I admire that in a man with a mask.
You don't really think you'll win, do you?
Things change.
I saw her first. Got to fly.
How could you? I'm a woman!
I'm sorry.
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.
Life's a bitch, now so am I.
Who are you?
Who's the man behind the bat?
Maybe you can help me find...
...the woman...
...behind the cat.
No, that's not you.
There you are.
Saved by Kitty Litter.
Bastard!
Alfred...
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?
Not really.
I may have saved the mayor's baby...
...but I refuse to save a mayor...
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.
Thank you.
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.
And you're the hottest young person...
...a role model could have.
Here.
Wear a button.
Let me just get it on here.
Thank you.
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...
...touching people, groping people.
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!
It's Oswald Cobblepot.
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.
Just the pussy I've been looking for.
It's chilly in here.
I'll warm you.
Down, Oswald.
We need to talk.
You see...
...you and I have something in common.
Sounds familiar.
Appetite for destruction?
Contempt for the czars of fashion?
Wait, don't tell me.
Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.
The thorn in both our sides.
The fly in our ointment.
Ointment?
I've got scented and unscented.
I'll come back later.
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause today:
Ban the Bat.
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.
He'd have even more power as a martyr.
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.
Namely, us.
Frame him?
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.
Those names are not for prying eyes.
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.
Nice birdie.
Nice kitty.
Nice kitty.
Batman napalmed my arm.
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.
A plan is forming.
I want in.
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...
...dirty.
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath
right here.
I challenge the mayor...
...to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?
The Love Connection perhaps?
...not that I have any faith in the mayor.
But I hope and pray...
...that Batman...
...will be present to preserve the peace.
Subtle.
Why are you doing this?
Selina?
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.
I don't see how, but...
It's nice to see you in the real world,
away from Shreck.
It's nice to be here.
Are you all right?
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.
Boy, the news these days.
Weird!
I heard on TV that Catwoman
weighs 140 pounds.
How do these hacks sleep at night?
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?
He probably saved millions
in property damage alone.
You're not going to the re-lighting
of the tree, are you?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?
No darker than yours.
Why don't you come over
and we can watch it on TV?
The tree-lighting ceremony.
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.
How about coming for dinner at five?
Let's say six?
Five.
Five. You and me.
The tree lights up
and then I push the button.
Wait, wait.
I push the button, then the tree lights up.
Who are you?
Talent scout.
Come in.
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.
What is that thing?
A camera or something?
Say, "Cheese! "
Cheese.
Thanks, Alfred.
I'm sure he's wonderful company...
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit
get a little stale?
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.
Executive Assistant.
Sorry.
Secretary.
Any girlfriend?
Sure.
You mean, as in serious?
No. Had one, didn't work.
What went wrong? Hang on!
I think I know!
You kept things from her.
I told her everything.
The truth frightened her?
There are two truths...
...you know?
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...
...reconciling them.
Vicki thought...
Vicki?
Ice skater or stewardess?
No, she was a photojournalist.
Was Vicki right about your...
...difficulty with duality?
You see...
...if I say yes, then...
...you'll think of me as a...
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...
You might not let me kiss you.
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.
I can't do that.
Neither can I.
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?
The evidence is purely circumstantial.
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.
I've got to go to the plaza.
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.
Shit!
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
"be-my-girlfriend" way...
I'll relay the message.
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...
Bruce, yes...
Would you tell him...
...l've been going through...
a lot of changes and...
Just that...
...this is not a rejection...
...my abruptly leaving.
In fact, he makes me feel the way...
...I hope I really am.
Could you just make up a sonnet or...
a dirty limerick?
One has just sprung to mind.
This way, ma'am.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Please, may I have your attention?
I know that to many of you...
...Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.
But I want you to know
your elected officials...
...and your police department...
...have the situation well in hand.
Got to hurry.
Thank you.
It was set up to look like I did it.
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.
Did somebody say fish?
I haven't been fed all day.
Eat floor.
High fiber.
Hey, stud...
...I thought we had something together.
- We do.
Got to go. Girl talk.
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.
Be careful. Don't move.
Lawn dart!
Rats with wings, do your thing.
Batman pushed the Princess!
Hold your fire!
You're catnip to a girl like me.
Handsome, dazed...
...and to die for.
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.
But a kiss...
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.
You're the second man
who's killed me this week.
But I've got seven lives left.
I tried to save you...
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.
Or deeply resentful.
Maybe you should retire.
Damn.
Outstanding!
You're Beauty and the Beast...
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.
She looked pretty scared to me.
A touch of the bubbly?
So what are we waiting for?
Let's consummate our fiendish union.
What?
Oh, come on.
Can't you picture?
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.
I'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...
...twitching your little tail...
...my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.
Please.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!
I don't think I like you anymore!
Good-bye, my unintended.
Go to heaven.
There he is!
Don't adjust your sets.
Welcome...
...to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.
Gentlemen, start your screaming.
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!
Relax.
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!
You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!
That's funny.
Now I'm a little worried.
So he survived. Why worry?
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!
Listen to them. They've lost faith
in old symbols.
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.
If it works, don't fix it.
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.
Shreck and Cobblepot...
...the visionary alliance.
When it came time...
...to ensure the safety of our fair city...
...did the mayor have a plan?
No!
He relied on a man.
A Batman.
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...
Our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque.
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.
There's security to consider.
We can't just take it to any old body shop.
Security?
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?
I'm working, I turn around and there she is.
"Hi, Vick. Come on in."
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.
You ask... am I up here for personal glory?
No.
The glory that I yearn to recapture...
...is the glory of Gotham!
How can this be accomplished?
I know...
...you're all concerned.
Relax.
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.
I didn't say that.
You must admit I played
this stinking city...
...like a harp from hell!
You must admit...
...I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?
There he is!
My babies.
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Great speech, Oswald.
My name is not Oswald!
It's Penguin!
I am not a human being!
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!
Crank the A.C.!
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!
It's time.
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.
Just like I was.
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.
Tonight, while their parents party...
...they'll be dreaming away...
...in their safe cribs...
...their soft beds...
...and we'll snatch them...
...carry them into the sewer...
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.
Penguin?
Killing sleeping children...
...isn't that a little...
No, it's a lot.
A reminder.
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.
May we RSVP
in the resoundingly negative?
Not interested.
Although...
...Selina Kyle might be there.
Ingenious costume.
Let me guess.
Trust-fund goody-goody?
Feeling good?
You almost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city...
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.
Does it matter who's mayor?
It does to me.
Yawn.
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.
No hard feelings then?
Actually...
...semi-hard, I'd say.
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.
Why don't we...
Take off our costumes?
I'm tired of wearing masks.
Me too.
Let me ask you something.
Why'd you come tonight?
- You first.
- To see you.
Lovely.
I wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.
Do you mean you...
Not you and Max?
Me and Max?
No. This and Max.
Don't tell me killing Max
won't solve anything, because it will.
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...
...coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?
I don't know anymore, Bruce.
A kiss under the mistletoe.
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...
"...if you mean it."
Oh, my God.
Does this mean we have to start fighting?
Let's go outside.
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.
You didn't invite me...
...so I crashed!
What do you want?
Right now, my troops...
...are fanning out across town...
...for your children!
Yes!
For your first-born sons!
The ones you left defenseless at home...
...so you could dress up like jerks...
...get juiced and dance...
...badly!
I've personally come...
...for Gotham's favorite son...
...Mr. Chip Shreck.
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...
...to die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.
I don't. So, no!
I'm the one you want.
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you?
Isn't it Max, not Chip...
...you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Okay, you got a point.
I'll let the little prince live, for now.
In the duck!
This is going to be good...
...to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...
...before their prime.
You ask me... how do I lure them in?
A little "Pied Penguin" action.
And you get to watch them sink...
...into a deep puddle...
...of your industrial by-products.
Then...
...you join them.
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.
Right this way, kiddies.
Come with me.
So where are all the children?
"Dear Penguin:
"The children regret
they're unable to attend.
"Batman! "
My dear penguins...
...we stand on a great threshold!
It's okay to be scared!
Many of you won't be coming back.
Thanks to Batman...
...the time has come...
...to punish all God's children!
First-, second-, third- And fourth-born!
Why be biased?
Male and female!
Hell, the sexes are equal...
...with their erogenous zones...
...blown sky-high!
Forward...
...march!
The liberation of Gotham...
...has begun!
The penguins are moving above ground.
Penguin army...
...approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.
One minute until ignition.
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...
...so I'm laying them on a slab!
Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.
Thirty seconds until ignition.
Estimated casualties after launch:
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.
Fifteen seconds to ignition.
Ready when you are, sir.
I've got the coordinates.
Let's turn them around.
Something is wrong.
Something has jammed the signal.
They seem to be turning around.
There is also something coming this way.
Very large. Very fast.
Who's there?
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.
You're jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...
...and you have to wear a mask!
You might be right.
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?
My babies!
I don't know what you want,
but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.
Money.
Jewels.
A very big ball of string.
Your blood, Max.
I gave at the office.
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.
Let's make a deal!
Other than my blood, what can I do?
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
You're not just saving a life...
Shut up. You're going to jail.
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him... or us.
Wrong on both counts.
Why do this?
Let's just take him to the police.
Then we can go home...
...together.
Selina...
...don't you see?
We're the same.
We're the same.
Split...
...down the center.
Please.
Bruce...
...I would love to live with you

HROLD: Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.
This is my cab.
HAROLD: I was here first!
Oh, od.
Taxi! Taxi!
[Cars honking]
HAROLD: Taxi!
HAROLD: Let's go across. Come on.
HAROLD: We'll get one down the road.
Hurry.
WOMAN: For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?
HAROLD: I'm trying to get a.... Taxi!
JlMMY: We're going the wrong way!
Jimmy, put that away.
We look like tourists.
HAROLD: Let's cut over to Seventh.
JlMMY: Seventh is that way.
HAROLD: I know where we are!
[Footsteps]
PANHANDLER: Hey, give me a dollar.
How about it? One dollar.
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?
HAROLD: Come on! Up here.
[Harold groans]
GOON: Hey, lady...
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.
[Woman screams]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Hey, all right!
American Express card.
GOON ON LEFT:
"Don't leave home without it."
[Goons chuckle]
Get out of here.
I don't like it up here.
Are you scared of heights?
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs--
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.
That ain't what I heard at all.
I heard that the Bat got him.
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?
GOON: Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.
No shit. It was all over the pavement.
-I'm getting out of here.
-Shut up. Listen to me.
There ain't no Bat.
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! Shut up!
[Footsteps]
[Goon groans]
[Goon groans]
GOON: Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
GOON: Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
BATMAN: I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.
Tell all your friends about me.
What are you?
I'm Batman.
[Man cries and groans]
[Dramatic instrumental beat]
[Gasps]
[Police sirens blaring in the distance]
MAYOR: Across this nation...
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.
Our streets are overrun,
our public officials are helpless.
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...
...Boss Carl Grissom.
Now, our new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent...
...will carry out that promise.
[Cheering and applause]
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.
People of Gotham City...
...I'm a man of few words.
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.
HARVEY:
Commissioner Gordon informs me...
...that he has targeted those businesses...
...suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.
Before this week is out...
...we are going to knock
down their doors...
...and shed the light of the law
on that nest of vipers.
[Cheering and applause]
HARVEY: Together, we can make
this city safe for decent people.
[Cheering]
Decent people shouldn't live here.
They'd be happier someplace else.
Pretty tough talk about Carl.
Forget about it.
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.
If Grissom knew about us...
...he might hand you something.
Don't flatter yourself, angel.
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.
And besides...
...he doesn't know.
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?
You look fine.
I didn't ask.
MAN: Yeah. Hanging on.
[Sirens blaring]
[Man groaning and crying]
ECKHARDT: Let me guess.
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.
COP: That's it. What are they seeing
up there?
They're drinking Drano.
COP: It's weird.
KNOX: Thanks for the tip.
Christ. Knox.
KNOX: Lieutenant, I hear we had
another Bat attack.
That's eight sightings in a month.
I hear the Commissioner's opened a file.
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.
GOON: I'm telling you, a giant bat!
Don't write about this. It will ruin
your already useless reputation.
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.
They say he can't be killed.
They say he drinks blood.
I say you're full of shit, Knox.
You can quote me on that.
KNOX: Is there a six-foot bat
in Gotham City?
Is he on the police payroll?
What's he pulling down, after taxes?
[Knox chuckles]
[Sirens blaring in the distance]
[Drumbeat]
JACK: Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.
ECKHARDT: Why don't you broadcast it?
JACK: Shut up and listen.
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.
ECKHARDT: That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.
Your problems are our problems.
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.
You ought to think about the future.
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future, Jack.
ECKHARDT: You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.
[Gun trigger clicks]
Better be sure.
See?
You can make a good decision
when you try.
[Jack chuckles]
Where've you been spending your nights?
[Ambient traffic sounds]
MAYOR: I don't care if this festival
is in debt, I want a parade.
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.
HARVEY: We may celebrate
in bankruptcy court.
It's $250,000 in debt
and we haven't seen one balloon.
MAYOR: You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.
MAYOR: I promised that, remember?
[Ambient newsroom sounds]
COLLEAGUE 1 : Welcome, Count Dracula.
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?
COLLEAGUE 2:
They buried your story on Batman.
COLLEAGUE 1: They bury garbage.
KNOX: This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.
I got something for you.
[All laugh]
KNOX: Very funny. You should have put
more gore under the fangs.
What a dick.
Hello, legs.
VlCKl: I'm reading your stuff.
KNOX: Well, I'm reading yours.
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.
Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.
KNOX: If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.
KNOX: You could get hurt doing this stuff.
What brings you here?
I'm here to see the wildlife in Gotham City.
KNOX: Wildlife?
VlCKl: Mm hmm.
Like what?
Like...bats.
-Who sent you?
-Nobody, really.
VlCKl: I just loved your story, and...
...l like bats.
Yeah?
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.
Okay, you're a visionary,
and also the only one who believes me.
I need something tangible.
Gordon's got a file.
I can't even get him on the phone.
He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit, right?
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.
No.
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?
VlCKl: No.
KNOX: Buy me lunch?
VlCKl: Maybe.
KNOX: I eat light.
GRlSSOM: Say this...
...son of a bitch...
...makes a connection
with us and with Axis Chemicals.
What kind of damage are we looking at?
ACCOUNTANT: If he ties us with
Axis Chemicals, we're dead and buried.
We should move immediately.
I say we break into the place...
...trash the office...
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.
Jack....
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...
...I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.
Me?
GRlSSOM: Hello, sweetheart.
Would you mind waiting in the next room?
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.
Carl....
Can somebody else do this?
JACK: The fumes in that place....
Jack....
It's an important job. I need...
...someone I can trust.
You...are my number one guy.
Now...
...don't forget...
...your lucky deck.
My friend...
...your luck is about to change.
PHONE: Police Department.
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.
[Clicking of ball spinning
on roulette machine]
[Ambient casino sounds]
Can I help you, sir?
Oh, thanks. Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.
Here you go.
-Good evening.
-A little crowded.
VlCKl: Excuse me. Excuse me.
Could you tell me who is Bruce Wayne?
I'm not sure.
Thanks anyway.
GORDON: Eight. I can make that eight.
I can make that eight.
KNOX: Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.
Be straight with me, Commissioner.
How're you making out?
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?
We have enough problems in this city...
...without worrying about ghosts.
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.
Excuse me, I'll be back.
Won't anybody go on record?
-Your Honor, great suit.
-No comment.
GORDON: Robert, what's up?
Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?
-Eckhardt.
-Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
KNOX: Mr. Gordon?
KNOX: Mr. Gordon?
[Eerie sounds]
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.
Look at this stuff.
Who is this guy?
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.
KNOX: He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.
KNOX: The more they've got,
the less they're worth.
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.
Check this out. He must have been
the King of the Wicker People.
[Knox and Vicki chuckle]
Where'd this come from?
VlCKl: I have no idea.
It's Japanese.
How do you know?
I bought it in Japan.
KNOX: Who are you?
BRUCE: Sorry. Bruce Wayne.
Alexander Knox.
I read your work. I like it a lot.
Thanks. Can I have a grant?
Vicki Vale.
Hi. Bruce Wayne.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't l?
You've got a wonderful eye.
Some people think she has two.
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.
Mr. Wayne, we need more champagne.
Is that all right?
Sure. Go ahead.
BRUCE: How many cases? Six? Six?
Six is good.
BRUCE: Six. Thanks.
Will you be in Gotham for a while?
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's "giant bat" stories.
Oh, right. The bat.... Batman.
A bit light after the war
in Corto Maltese, no?
What do you do for a living?
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.
Very unexpectedly, sir.
Will you two excuse me?
I think perhaps this way, sir.
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.
And give Knox a grant.
Nice talking with you, Wayne.
The rich....
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.
Look at this mirror.
KNOX: Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.
[Knox chuckles]
[Sound of video tape rewinding]
GORDON: What's up?
ROBERT: Anonymous tip.
ROBERT:
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.
GORDON:
if we could get him, we'd have Grissom.
GORDON:
Why wasn't i told? Who's in charge?
ROBERT: Eckhardt.
GORDON: Oh, my God!
GORDON: Come on, let's go.
[Electronic beeps]
ECKHARDT: Take a good look.
This is the guy.
Get a good look.
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?
Let's move out.
[Suspenseful music]
[Drawer slams]
[Papers ruffling, folders being thrown,
banging, clanking]
We've been ratted out, boys.
Watch it.
Freeze!
[Hissing of fumes escaping]
ECKHARDT: You take the right. Move it.
GORDON: What the hell's going on?
ECKHARDT: What are you trying to do?
I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.
This is Commissioner Gordon.
i want him taken alive.
i repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.
[Explosions]
[Gunshots, hissing of fumes escaping]
[Jack cackles]
[Groaning]
GOON: Let me down!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Oh, my God!
[Banging, hissing of fumes and
water escaping]
[Gunshots]
[Man groans]
Get up on the catwalk, on that side.
You take that side. Be very careful.
Jesus!
BOB: Let him go...or I'll do Gordon.
Nice outfit.
Come on, Jack, let's go!
BOB: Come on!
Eckhardt!
Think about the future.
[Gunshot]
[Jack screams]
[Jack groaning]
[Jack screaming]
GORDON: Goddamn it, we had him!
GORDON: Hold it right there!
[Glass shatters, hissing]
[Swoosh of batgun]
COP: Who is this guy?
GORDON: I don't know.
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.
[Water bubbling]
KNOX: If there's no Bat,
then who dropped Napier into the acid?
Suicide? I want to get this on tape.
Hello?
He hung up. What have you got?
Here's the inner city.
VlCKl: Here's the sightings so far.
Maybe Batman has
some sort of flight pattern.
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.
No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.
Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.
[Phone ringing]
[Dog barking in the distance]
[Metallic clanking of gate closing]
[Voice echoes] How's the soup?
[Voice echoes] Excuse me?
BRUCE: The soup. How is it?
VlCKl: It's great.
[Voice echoes] Could you pass the salt?
Sure.
[Footsteps echo]
[Bruce clears his throat]
BRUCE: Did you have trouble
finding the house?
No....
VlCKl: It was no problem.
BRUCE: Good.
Do you like eating in here?
Oh, yeah.
I don't think I've been in this room before.
[Vicki laughs]
You want to leave?
Yes.
ALFRED: There was young Master Bruce...
...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.
ALFRED: That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.
I think I've embarrassed him
for long enough.
ALFRED: I'm off to bed.
ALFRED: Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.
ALFRED: Good night, miss.
VlCKl: Good night, Alfred.
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Alfred.
VlCKl: He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.
Alfred's great. I couldn't find
my socks without him.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
Were you close to him?
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...
...it was fun.
-That sounds nice.
-Yeah.
What about your family?
Actually, Alfred is my family.
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.
Some of it is very much me.
Some isn't.
That dining room is definitely not you.
The dining room isn't.
DOCTOR: Let's see how we did.
[Jack gasping]
Oh, my God!
JACK: Mirror.
Mirror!
[Jack groaning and sobbing]
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed, Mr. Napier.
[Jack's sobbing turns into laughter]
You see what I have to work with here.
VlCKl: There are an awful lot of stairs
in this place.
My feet are killing me.
[Vicki giggles]
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.
One drink and I'm flying.
Why are you afraid of flying?
That you, sugar bumps?
GRlSSOM: Who are you?
JACK: It's me.
"Sugar bumps."
You're alive! I heard you'd been--
JACK: Fried?
Is that what you heard?
You set me up over a woman.
A woman!
You must be insane.
JACK: Don't bother.
Your life won't be worth spit!
JACK: I've been dead once already.
It's very liberating...
...if you think of it as...therapy.
Jack, listen.
Maybe we can cut a deal.
Jack?
Jack is dead, my friend.
You can call me...
...Joker.
As you can see...
...I'm a lot happier.
[Joker cackles]
[Grissom screams]
[Repeated gunshots,
circus music plays in background]
[Joker cackles]
JOKER: Oh, what a day.
[Vicki moans softly]
[Rythmic squeaking sound]
Gotham City.
It always brings a smile to my face.
JOKER: "Winged Freak...
"...Terrorizes...."
Wait'll they get a load of me.
Oooh....
[Joker cackles]
I've got an idea. How about lunch
at my place? I'll show you some photos.
Sure. Okay.
Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.
VlCKl: Okay, we'll do it later in the day.
I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I have to leave town for a few days.
-Okay, we'll do it when you get back.
-All right.
VlCKl: I have to go. I'm late.
Bye.
-Nice to see you again, ma'am.
-Nice to see you, too.
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.
Back, Miss Vale?
We'll be here for quite a while.
VlCKl: Well, bye.
[Footsteps]
JOKER: Honey....
You'll never believe
what happened to me today.
[Alicia moans]
[Joker chuckles]
JOKER: So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom...resurfaces...
...i'm the acting president.
And i say, starting with
this anniversary festival...
...we run this city into the ground.
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?
MAN: Yeah.
And what's with that stupid grin?
Life's been good to me.
[Joker chuckles]
What if we say "no"?
Well, Tony....
Nobody wants a war.
If we can't do business,
we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
[Hissing]
JOKER: I got a live one here.
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.
[Doors bang open]
[Joker cackles]
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.
You're crazy.
Haven't you ever heard
of the healing power of laughter?
JOKER: Now get out of here!
GOON: Let's go! Move it!
You think it over.
[Goons yelling orders,
Joker continues to cackle]
Go to the Globe, follow that reporter Knox.
Take your camera.
See what he knows about this Batman.
[Whispers] And, Bob...
...remember...you...
...are my number one...
...guy.
Yes, sir.
Your pals...
...they're not bad people.
Maybe we...
...ought to give them
a few days to think it over.
No?
Grease them now?
Okay.
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.
I'm glad you're dead.
I'm glad you're dead.
[Joker cackling]
I'm glad you're dead.
[Joker continues to cackle]
[Phone rings]
I need that.
KNOX: I'm losing confidence in you.
I thought we were a team.
Is this a personal issue for you?
I just want you to do your job.
I am doing my job.
And I'm protecting my partner.
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?
Who cares?
Forget Bruce Wayne. I'm onto Batman.
[Car engine hums]
[Dramatic instrumental music,
background]
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.
REPORTER: What is this affidavit you filed?
Grissom gave you his business?
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...
...to take over all his businesses
until he returns.
That's a big favor.
You two must have been very close.
Did you do time together as children?
[Suspenseful music, background]
ECKHARDT: Our accountants are looking
into it. The affidavit is legitimate.
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?
Of course you can.
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is legitimate.
JOKER: It is legitimate.
I saw it. I was there.
JOKER: I saw it all.
He reached up with his dead hand...
...and signed it in his own blood.
And he did it...with this pen.
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.
Time to pay the check.
[Crowd screams]
The pen...
...is truly mightier than the sword.
[Machine guns fire]
[Crowd screams in panic]
[Car tires squeal]
BRUCE: Get down!
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?
The festival opens.
The police will stop these gangsters.
What about the theory
that the Batman is a Mob enforcer?
i don't have any comment.
[Minor explosion]
JOKER: Batman.
Batman.
Can somebody tell me
what kind of a world we live in...
...when a man dressed as a bat...
...gets all my press?
This town needs an enema!
[Party horn blows]
May I have a glass of...water?
I'm relieved that you're home.
ALFRED: Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.
Alfred...
...why don't you marry her?
That's not exactly what I had in mind, sir.
I can't go on with that right now.
If not now...
...when?
[Whispers] I don't know.
Jack Napier's still alive.
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Alfred....
She is great, isn't she?
ALFRED: Yes.
KNOX: Knox.
VlCKl: Hi.
Check something out for me.
Find out what's special
about the alley at Pearl and Phillips.
KNOX: Pearl and Phillips?
VlCKl: Yeah.
KNOX: You got it.
VlCKl: Okay. Okay, bye.
Mr. Wayne.
[Whistling]
So much to do and so little time.
The photos.
Who's that loss?
BOB: Knox.
JOKER: Bad tie. No style.
Stop the press!
JOKER: Who is that?
BOB: Vicki Vale.
The photographer working with Knox.
That girl has style.
Jesus marimba!
A lovely beast like that running around...
...could put steam in a man's strides.
She's dating some guy named Wayne.
She's about to trade up.
It's hard to stay inside the lines.
I'm about...
...to get a new girl, Bobby.
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.
Phone book.
Yes, sir.
JOKER: So much to do...
...and so little time.
[Truck honking]
JOKER:
Have you shipped a million of those?
MAN: Yes, sir.
Ship them all! We're going
to take them out a whole new door!
FLOOR MANAGER:
Ten seconds to transmission.
Five...four...three...two...one.
TV DlRECTOR: Cue music.
Cue Becky.
Good evening. The fashion world
was stunned today...
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.
Peter.
Plans continue
for the city's 200th birthday...
...as Mayor Borg announced today,
the unveiling--
This just in.
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--
[Becky giggles]
...were discovered today.
[Becky laughs hysterically]
What's going on?
This is hardly the....
Kill the camera.
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!
JOKER:
New and improved Joker products!
With a new secret ingredient.
Smylex!
What's that?
JOKER: Let's go over...
...to our blind taste-test.
Love that Joker.
Where's it coming from?
He doesn't look happy.
He's been using brand X.
But with new Joker Brand...
...i get a grin again...
JOKER:...and again.
That luscious tan...
... those ruby lips...
...and hair color so natural,
only your undertaker knows for sure.
[Joker laughs]
JOKER: You're saying:
"Where can i get these fine, new items?"
That's the gag. Chances are,
you've bought them already!
Love that Joker.
JOKER: Remember...
...put on a happy face.
[Joker laughing]
The information you requested.
BRUCE: "Jack Napier, assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.
"Results of psychological profile...
"...violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.
"Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."
Chemistry.
Let's go shopping.
Yes, sir.
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.
And what is the pattern?
Foods, alcohol,
or beauty and hygiene products?
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.
The search goes on
through Gotham's shopping nightmare.
MAYOR: We are having a festival, if I have
to use a gun to get people there myself.
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!
MAYOR: Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.
Do you read me?
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.
[Answering machine beeps]
VlCKl: Hi, it's Vicki.
i'll be ten minutes late to the museum.
i'll see you when you get there.
A message from Miss Vale.
She'll be late meeting you at the museum.
Okay, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.
I'm not meeting her today.
Jack, where are you going?
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.
[Classical music plays softly, background]
VlCKl: Mr. Wayne's table?
He hasn't arrived yet.
We have a table waiting.
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.
[Hissing]
[Crash]
[People panicking]
[Bang]
Gentlemen!
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.
[Pop rock song by Prince]
Give him a shave.
Terence, brush.
"All hail
The new king in town "
"Young and old,
Gather 'round
"Black and white,
Red and green
"The funkiest man
You've ever seen
"Tell you what his name is
"Partyman, Partyman
"Rock a party
Like nobody can
"Rules and regulations
No place in this nation
"Partyman, Partyman
"Party people
Say it now
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah "
The one-dollar bill.
"Somebody holler
if you wanna party"
JOKER: Hold it!
I kind of like this one. Leave it.
You can take that off now.
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.
[Hissing]
Your portfolio?
I'm meeting someone
who wants to see my work.
JOKER: Crap.
Crap. Crap.
Crap. Crap.
Now that's good work.
The skulls, the bodies.
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about.
I was in the bath one day...
...when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.
You know how concerned
people are about appearances.
This is attractive, that is not.
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.
I make art...until someone dies.
See?
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.
What do you want?
My face on the one-dollar bill.
[Vicki sighs]
You're joking.
Do I look like I'm joking?
No.
Listen.
We mustn't compare ourselves
to regular people. We're artists.
JOKER: For instance, let me challenge you
with a piece I did.
Bob. Alicia.
You will photograph and record my work.
You will join me in the avant-garde
of the new aesthetic.
ALlClA: Jack, you said I could watch you
improve the paintings.
I'm in trouble now.
VlCKl: Why is she wearing a mask?
She's just a sketch, really.
Alicia, sit down. Show the lady
why you wear this mask.
Alicia's been made over in line
with my new philosophy.
So now, like me...
...she is a living work of art.
I'm no Picasso, but...do you like it?
It's great.
So...what can I do for you?
A little song, a little dance.
Batman's head on a lance.
What do you know about...?
I don't know anything about Batman.
Really?
Well, how about a little "you and me"?
You're insane.
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.
JOKER: Let's make up. Have a little...
...whiff of my posy.
[Vicki screams]
JOKER: Help me!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!
[Vicki screams]
[Glass shatters]
[Swooshing sound]
[High-pitched hissing]
Hold on.
[Vicki screams]
Where does he get those wonderful toys?
BATMAN: Get in the car.
VlCKl: Which one?
[Car engine roars]
[Tires squeal]
[Crash]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Vicki screams]
[Crashing]
[Police sirens blaring]
[Vicki screams]
[Hissing and clanking]
Let's go.
[Sirens scream]
[Tires screech]
[Running footsteps]
BATMAN: Shields.
[Clanking, buzzing and hissing]
[Metallic clanking]
[Vicki screams]
How much do you weigh?
About 108, I think.
[Tires squealing]
[Hissing]
Hold on.
[Car screeches to a halt]
[Vicki screams]
BATMAN: Grab that thing on my belt.
BATMAN: Don't let go.
[Vicki screams]
[Grunting and groaning]
[Gunshot]
GOON: No blood.
Who is this guy?
Check his wallet.
-Wait.
-What is that?
GOON: Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.
Take off the mask.
BOB: Shoot her!
[Gunshots]
[High-pitched raging scream]
[Swords clink]
[Loud hissing of sword cutting the air]
BATMAN: Shields open.
[Mechanical buzzing and hissing]
[Engine revs]
[Sirens blare]
BATMAN: You weigh more than 108.
VlCKl: Really?
BATMAN: Let's go.
Stop.
[Vicki gasps]
[Batmobile screeches to a halt]
Where are we going?
[Dramatic instrumental music,
background]
[Vicki screams]
BATMAN: Be careful.
[Clanking of lever, explosive sound]
[Bats flapping their wings]
[Whispers] Bats.
BATMAN: They're great survivors.
VlCKl: What is all this?
BATMAN: The police have got it wrong.
They're looking for one product.
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.
VlCKl: Then whole shipments
would be poisoned.
And we'd all be dead.
BATMAN: No.
The poison only works if the components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.
How did you figure this out?
BATMAN: Take that to the press.
I might have trouble with that.
A lot of people think
you're as dangerous as the Joker.
BATMAN: He's psychotic.
Some people say the same thing
about you.
BATMAN: What people?
Well, let's face it.
You're not exactly normal...are you?
BATMAN: It's not exactly a normal world.
VlCKl: Why did you bring me here?
VlCKl: You could have sent that stuff
to the press yourself.
BATMAN: You're right.
BATMAN: There is something else
you have that I want.
VlCKl: What?
[Bats screeching]
[Vicki moans]
He took the film.
[Phone rings]
Yeah?
Where have you been? Are you okay?
Should I come over?
VlCKl: No, Allie.
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?
Just barely. Is it hot?
Yeah, it's real hot.
Yeah, bye.
Copy!
Avoid the following combinations:
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.
Safe products are flying in
as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.
Friend or foe?
I have given a name to my pain...
...and it is Batman.
[Gunshot, minor explosion]
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.
We've got a flying mouse to kill...
...and I want to clean my claws.
ALFRED: Sir, Miss Vale called again.
ALFRED: Dare i suggest
that your present course of action...
...might simply strengthen her resolve?
She is quite tenacious.
You're right.
And quite special.
Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.
[Doorbell rings]
VlCKl: Coming.
Hi.
May I come in?
BRUCE: This is a nice apartment.
Lots of space.
Listen, I came over to...
-...clear--
-I don't know who you think you are!
-You hurt me.
-I know.
VlCKl: I called you and called you.
And you lied! You lied about leaving town.
-Let me tell you why.
-Let me tell you!
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.
I even slept with you.
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.
You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot,
but right now, shut up.
I have something to tell you.
[Bruce sighs]
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?
Uh huh.
Sometimes...
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.
Oh, my God, you're married.
No, I'm not married.
You see...
...my life is really...
...complex.
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...
...goes downstairs...
...and eats breakfast...
...and kisses somebody good-bye,
and goes to...
...a job, and, you know....
No.
No.
Look.
What I'm trying to tell you is....
Hey, it's okay.
VlCKl: You can tell me.
BRUCE: Okay.
[Doorbell rings]
What I'm trying to tell you is....
[Doorbell rings again]
VlCKl: I'll be right back.
[Vicki screams]
JOKER: Miss me?
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.
Vicki, we've really got to talk.
JOKER: I'm very upset.
JOKER: We were having dinner.
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.
And without so much as an apology...
...you ran off with that sideshow phony.
You know...
...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.
Alicia...
...threw herself out a window.
Oh, my God.
But...
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.
[Vicki screams, Joker cackles]
Well, Miss Vale...
...another rooster in the hen-house?
Take thy beak from out my heart.
Bruce....
Bruce...Wayne, n'est-ce pas?
BRUCE: Most of the time.
I know who you are.
Let me tell you
about this guy I know, Jack.
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.
I like him already.
[Joker and Bob cackle]
You know what the problem was?
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.
He started to lose it.
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.
Couldn't keep it straight up here.
He was the kind of guy who...
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.
You know what happened
to this guy, Jack?
Well....
He made mistakes.
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?
Come on! Let's get nuts!
Tell me something.
Have you ever danced
with the devil in the pale moonlight?
What?
I always ask that of all my prey.
I just like the sound of it.
[Gunshot, Vicki screams]
Never rub another man's rhubarb.
Why is it, every time I come for you...
...somebody always gets in the way?
JOKER: I'll need a moment alone.
I'm only laughing on the outside.
My smile is just skin deep.
If you could see inside...
...I'm really crying.
You might join me for a weep.
[Joker cackles]
[Vicki gasps]
[Metallic clanking as tray falls]
[Vicki gasps]
[Ambient newsroom sounds]
VlCKl: You really wouldn't believe it.
KNOX: While you were entertaining, I've
been finding out about your street corner.
KNOX: I think your friend is screwed up.
VlCKl: More good news.
Oh, my God!
His parents were murdered in that alley.
That's why he went there.
KNOX:
He watched it happen in front of him.
VlCKl: Look at the look on his face.
It was the same at City Hall.
What do you suppose this does to a kid?
Vale....
Don't get personal!
BRUCE: Alfred....
Did you get the file on my parents?
ALFRED: It's on your table.
BRUCE: Thank you.
BRUCE: What's on your mind, Alfred?
ALFRED: I have no wish
to fill my few remaining years...
...grieving for the loss of old friends...
[Metallic clanking]
...or their sons.
[Scattered conversations]
[Banging on microphone]
MAYOR:
The 200th anniversary birthday gala...
...has been indefinitely postponed.
We cannot guarantee public safety.
JOKER: Joker here.
TECHNlClAN: We got interference.
JOKER: Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.
Some of which were true
under that fiend...
...Boss Grissom.
He was a thief...and a terrorist.
On the other hand,
he had a tremendous singing voice.
JOKER: He's dead now,
and he's left me in charge.
i can be theatrical...
...and maybe even a little rough.
But one thing i am not...
...is a killer!
[Young people laugh]
JOKER: i love a good party.
So, truce.
Commence au festival!
JOKER: And i've got a surprise
for Gotham City.
At midnight, i will dump
...on the crowd.
[Crowd gasping]
JOKER: Don't worry about me.
i've got enough.
We are not prepared to discuss any deals.
You heard it, folks, 20 million.
JOKER: And there will be entertainment.
The big dukeroo. With me in one corner,
and in the other corner...
...the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...
...Batman.
JOKER: Can you hear me?
Just the two of us.
Mano y mano.
i have taken off my make-up.
JOKER: Let's see...
...if you can take off yours.
[Clicking footsteps]
[Ominous choral music, background]
[Echoing footsteps]
[Echoing gunshots, distorted screams]
JACK: [Distorted voice] Tell me, kid.
Have you ever danced
with the devil by the pale moonlight?
Let's go!
GOON: Let's go, Jack!
See you around.
VlCKl: Am I crazy?
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?
VlCKl:
We both got to each other, didn't we?
Why won't you let me in?
Why?
You got in.
I've loved you since I met you.
But I don't know what to think of all this.
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.
Why?
Because nobody else can.
Look....
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.
This is how it is.
It's not a perfect world.
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.
I just have to know,
are we going to try to love each other?
I'd like to.
But he's out there right now.
And I've got to go to work.
[Metallic clanging]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Engine revs]
[Gunshots]
[Metallic clinking]
[Thunderous explosion]
JOKER: into the air, Junior Birdman!
Miss me?
[Joker cackles]
JOKER: Yeah! Watch me!
[Helicopter propellers pelting]
[Pop rock song by Prince continues,
background]
[Ambient festive sounds]
[Crowd cheers]
Get them. Take the pictures.
Gotham's greed.
[Dramatic instrumental beat]
And now, folks...
...it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
Money, money! Who do you trust?
Me? i'm giving away free money.
And where...is the Batman?
He's at home, washing his tights.
[Joker cackles, crowd cheers]
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.
Bob. Mask.
Masks! Put them on now!
JOKER: And now...
...comes the part...
...where i relieve you, the little people...
...of the burden...of your failed...
...and useless lives.
But, as my plastic surgeon always said,
"if you've got to go...
"...go with a smile. "
My God.
VlCKl: Smylex gas.
He's going to kill everybody!
KNOX: Get in the car. Get in the car!
[Sounds of panic and chaos]
Hurry!
[Vicki screams]
[Crowd yelling and screaming
from panic and fear]
[Swooshing sound of Batmobile]
[Glass shatters]
[Minor explosions]
[Swooshing sound]
[Sounds of chaos]
[Tires screech]
Aaa....
[Crash]
[Swooshing sound]
[Beep]
My balloons!
They're my balloons!
[Hissing and clanking]
He stole my balloons!
Why didn't somebody tell me
he had one of those...things?
Bob. Gun.
[Gunshot]
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.
Get out of here!
[Gunshots]
[Yelling and screaming]
[Beeping]
[Clanking and hissing]
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.
[Beep]
[Multiple gunshots]
[Beeping]
[Multiple gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Engine roaring]
[Explosions]
[Roaring explosion]
[Flames crackling]
[Explosions]
JOKER: Darling.
JOKER: I've got to get you
to the church on time.
GOON: Yes, sir?
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.
GOON: Right away, sir?
JOKER: Five minutes.
Better make it ten.
[Metallic clanking]
[Crashing and banging]
[Ominous instrumental music,
background]
[Sirens blaring]
[Crash]
GORDON: Let's go.
Point those searchlights at the tower.
Now! Move!
JOKER: [Voice echoing] it can be truly said
that i have a bat in my belfry.
JOKER: Shall we dance?
[High-pitched screaming]
[Waltz music plays]
[Goon yells]
[Crash]
[Grunting]
[Crash]
You know, without you...
...l just wouldn't want to go on.
[Vicki screams]
[Joker cackles]
[Grunting and groaning]
JOKER: We were made for each other.
JOKER: Beauty and the Beast.
Of course, if anyone calls you "Beast"...
...I'll rip their lungs out.
[Kissing sounds]
Mr. Joker?
VlCKl: You say such beautiful things.
And you're so powerful. And purple!
I love purple!
BATMAN: Excuse me.
Have you ever danced with the devil
in the pale moonlight?
[Crashing, banging, grunting]
I'm going to kill you.
You idiot!
You made me, remember?
You dropped me into the chemicals!
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.
I know you did.
[Joker groans]
[Fake teeth rattle]
[Joker grunts and groans]
BATMAN: You killed my parents.
What?
What are you saying?
BATMAN: I made you,
but you made me first.
I was just a kid.
I say you made me, you say I made you.
How childish can you get?
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on?
[Vicki screams]
[Joker cackles]
JOKER: What are you laughing at?
Let me lend you a hand.
[Vicki screams]
Lend you a hand!
JOKER: They don't make them
like they used to!
Hey, Batsy!
[Helicopter propellers pelting]
There he is! Down there!
It's time to retire.
Feel free to drop in.
Sometimes I just kill myself!
Hold on!
[Swoosh]
[Joker groans]
[Joker screams]
[Vicki screams]
[Mechanical laughter]
HARVEY: Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.
The reign of crime is over.
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.
-Aren't you covering the press conference?
-No.
What about our Pulitzer Prize?
What about us?
What about your picture of Batman?
Take care.
HARVEY:
We received a letter from Batman.
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...
"...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.
HARVEY:
"But if the forces of evil should rise again...
"...to cast a shadow
on the heart of the city...
"...call me. "
KNOX: Question. How do we call him?
He gave us a signal.
[Dramatic instrumental theme song]
ALFRED: I thought champagne would
be in order, ma'am.
VlCKl: Hi, Alfred.
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...
...that he might be a little late.
I'm not a bit surprised.

This yacht is bringing a
revolutionary invention to Gotham.
On a peaceful motor ride,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...
...and his ward, Dick Grayson,
have been summoned to Wayne Manor...
...by an urgent but anonymous
call for help.
The invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger...
...aboard the yacht.
Never ones
to shirk responsibility...
...Bruce and Dick, with
characteristic speed and resolve...
...descend promptly to the Batcave.
And then, as they have done
many times before...
...as Batman and Robin,
courageous warriors against crime...
...they are off, once again,
to the rescue.
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Roger. Ready to move out.
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.
Batmobile approaching.
MAN: Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all
aircraft in the control zone.
Enter your holding pattern.
Batcopter cleared for takeoff.
It's good to know
they're up there doing their job.
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.
Roger. Correcting to port.
Altitude: 31 7. Sink rate: 0.49.
-Drop Bat ladder.
-Bat ladder away.
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.
Watch out. This could be tricky.
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits
about me. So long, for a minute.
Batman to Robin,
ease off on the power!
Increase sink rate!
Roger! Wilco!
Take her up!
Holy sardine!
Hand me down
the shark-repellent Bat spray!
GORDON: Enough pictures.
BATMAN: This must be brief.
O'HARA: You're lucky they'll talk.
-Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times.
A yacht approaching the city
is said to have disappeared.
-Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
-lt isn't true?
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of The Globe.
-lt was a Big Ben Distilleries yacht?
-That's right.
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...
...bringing with him a new invention
from Big Ben's lab?
-No more questions about that ship.
-What about that shark?
BATMAN: Unfortunately, it chanced
to swallow a floating mine.
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss--
Comrade Kitanya lrenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.
From The Moscow Bugle.
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?
Please, take off the mask
to give the better picture.
-Batman take off his mask?
O'HARA: She's mad.
BATMAN:
Chief O'Hara, all of you.
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...
...however, impossible to grant.
-lmpossible?
-lndeed.
If we were to remove our masks,
our true identities would be revealed.
-Ruining their value as crime fighters.
-Not even we know who they are.
In fact, our own relatives don't know.
But your so curious costumes....
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.
You're like the masked vigilantes
in the Westerns?
Batman and Robin are
deputized agents of the law!
-"Support your police" is our message.
-Well said, Robin.
And no better way to end
this conference.
-Thank you and good day.
MAN: Batman--
O'HARA: Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.
A fine job. You allayed their fears.
If l'd told the truth,
panic would grip the city.
The truth. And what is the truth?
A decoy. An anonymous warning...
...that Schmidlapp's in danger,
to lure me into a trap.
An attempt on his life.
While they were luring you
to a watery grave...
...the yacht was being hijacked?
-Precisely!
-And who behind it?
What known super criminals
are at large now?
I'll check at once, Batman.
Let's have the latest status report
on criminals at large. Thank you.
Coming up on
the closed-circuit TV screen.
MAN: Status report. Known super
criminals not currently imprisoned.
BATMAN:
Penguin.
That pompous waddling
master of foul play...
...maestro of a million
criminal umbrellas.
ROBlN: Joker!
O'HARA: Clown prince of crime!
If l had a nickel
for every time he baffled us!
GORDON:
The Riddler too?
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.
ROBlN: Gosh, and the Catwoman!
-End of status report.
Could be any one of them,
but which one?
Which ones?
Pretty fishy what happened to me
on that ladder.
-Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
-Wait! lt happened at sea.
See? "C" for Catwoman!
Yet, that exploding shark
was pulling my leg.
-The Joker!
-lt all adds up to a sinister riddle.
Riddler. Riddler?
A thought strikes me.
So dreadful l scarcely dare
give it utterance.
The four of them.
Their forces combined.
-Holy nightmare!
-Batman, could it be?
I don't know.
But l think I know
where to find a clue.
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!
Ahoy, Catwoman.
How many times have l told you?
Never use my real name in public!
You and your trained exploding shark!
How should I know they'd have a can...
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!
You pompous puffed-up penguin!
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Sic them, Hecate,
scratch out their eyes.
-Take away that ravenous panther!
-l'll feed him to the birds.
I'll incapacitate it
with my trick confetti!
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...
...as the members
of the United World headquarters.
-What's the matter with you all?
-She's right.
If we don't manage to swallow
our super-criminal pride--
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!
We must hang together,
or we shall hang separately.
What a pity that would be on the eve
of the greatest criminal coup ever!
-How did it go, Catwoman?
-Perfectly. Perfectly.
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.
-The fools are completely baffled.
-But undrowned.
Yes, unfortunately.
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!
Our prisoner still doesn't know
he's kidnapped?
He just keeps ringing for his tea.
[BELL RINGS]
-There he goes again.
PENGUlN: Take it to him, man.
[FOG HORN BLOWS]
[KNOCKlNG]
Come in.
Your tea, commodore.
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.
Are you getting enough sea air?
My duties keep me mostly undercover.
Too bad.
How much longer will this yacht
be fogbound off the Grand Banks?
I couldn't say, sir.
Well, gives me a chance
to catch up on my Dickens.
Still, l'd like to get to Gotham City.
I've a clever invention with me,
stored down in the hold.
Should be worth
millions of dollars, pip-pip!
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you
wish anything further, just ring!
[FOG HORN BLOWS]
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...
...the whole world almost literally
in our grasp!
And Batman and Robin
still alive to block us.
Everything pip-pip with
the prisoner! Hasn't a clue.
-l bet the Dynamic Duo has.
-What?
A clue on how we made
that ship disappear.
-And when they solve it--
-They'll be out to investigate.
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.
Catwoman, you tend
to this headquarters.
-Attention, you unfathomable finks!
-Yo-ho!
Call down to
our secret river-bottom dock.
-Prepare our submarine for sea.
-Yo-ho!
-Yo-ho what?
-Sir!
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.
BATMAN: My hunch was right.
-l don't get it--
Think! As you remarked,
no one can make...
...a seagoing vessel
simply disappear.
Provided it was ever
really there at all.
-You mean--?
-Precisely!
The yacht we thought we saw
was a mere illusion.
A tricky projection akin
to the common desert mirage.
It deceived our naked eyes...
...but was blocked
by the Batcamera's Batfilter!
I know where
that projection came from.
-Observe that bell buoy.
ROBlN: What about it?
The coordinates of our position
were 1 0.3 by 69-B.
Feed those figures into
the navigational aid computer.
Roger.
No legal bell buoy at that position.
As l surmised, an illegal projection
buoy cleverly camouflaged.
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!
-One thing l don't dig, Batman.
-Oh?
If that ship was a mirage,
where's the real one?
Taken to some secret island hideaway
with every soul aboard, save one.
-Commodore Schmidlapp?
-Precisely.
For some reason
the hijackers needed him...
...or his invention
as part of their criminal scheme.
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.
It looks like we've got
the whole ocean to ourselves.
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard,
three degrees.
Hoist three degrees.
I hope you know
what you're doing, Penguin.
Mr. Riddler, I ignore
your insipid insinuation, sir!
Mr. Joker, you're leaning
on the control!
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!
As the poet says:
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"
Now hear this. This is your captain
speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!
MAN: Yo-ho!
-What? What?
Unidentified small craft, bearing 1 1 3.
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.
BATMAN:
Watch your step, Robin.
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!
Nothing's sacred to those devils.
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.
Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!
Yo-ho!
Load torpedo tubes!
Salt and corrosion.
The infamous old enemies of
the crime fighter. No prints here.
Look here, Batman.
That tricky mirage projector
must be behind this plate.
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.
Look, Robin.
ROBlN: Holy Long John Silver!
A periscope!
He spotted us! Set torpedoes
to automatic homing.
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!
Activate the remote control
Penguin magnet inside that buoy.
Yo-ho!
Holy glue pot! What's going on?
The fiends! They've converted
this buoy into a gigantic magnet!
It's got us by the metallic objects
in our utility belts.
Torpedo tubes armed!
Batman! We're helpless
in this monstrous, invisible grip!
-Steady, Robin. l see one hope.
-What, Batman?
If l could just pry loose
my utility belt transmitter!
-Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
-Yo-ho, ready to fire!
Five, four, three, two.
-Fire 1 !
-Fire 1 !
Torpedoes!
If l can just reverse the polarity,
send out waves of super energy.
-What happened?
-Mr. Joker, fire 2!
Fire 2!
Here comes another one!
You and your reconditioned
surplus torpedoes!
He must be using a super energy
reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3!
Fire 3!
Here comes a third one!
Confound it, the batteries are dead!
This one's getting through!
It is. lt's getting through.
[TORPEDO EXPLODES]
Surface, Mr. Bluebeard!
Let us feast our eyes
on the watery remains!
Gosh, the nobility
of the almost-human porpoise.
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal...
...to hurl himself into
the path of that torpedo.
He gave his life for ours.
Operator, give me the Pentagon,
Navy department.
Too bad.
[PHONE RlNGS]
Admiral Fangschliester's office.
Hello, Batman speaking.
Oh, hello.
-Who is it?
-Batman.
Oh, Batman.
Hello, Batman. Ahoy!
What can I do for you?
Hello, admiral.
A routine question.
Have you recently sold surplus
submarines? lf so, to whom?
Just a moment,
I'll have to look that up.
[WHlSTLES]
Keep practicing.
Answer: affirmative. We disposed
of a surplus submarine on Friday.
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.
-P.N. Gwynne?
-The Penguin!
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?
No, thank you, admiral.
You've been very helpful.
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?
Disposing of submarines to persons
who don't even leave their addresses?
-Good day, admiral.
-Gosh!
The Penguin in command
of a pre-atomic submarine!
-Grave situation, Robin.
-lf only we knew what he was up to!
[RUMBLING]
Holy Polaris!
From that submarine, no doubt.
That missile, it's written something.
ROBlN:
A riddle, in the form of a joke!
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our fear is confirmed. Penguin,
Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.
-Heaven only knows the objective!
-lt may be worse.
Worse?
-Saints alive, how can that be?
-Look at this pair of riddles.
"What does a turkey do
when he flies upside down?"
-He gobbles up.
-Of course.
-And number two.
"What weighs 6 ounces,
sits in a tree and is dangerous?"
-A sparrow with a machine gun.
-Of course.
Now, combine both answers.
What kind of creature would
gobble up a bird in a tree?
Heaven protect us, a cat!
Yes, the criminal catalyst
in this entire affair...
...our old archenemy, Catwoman.
Penguin, Joker, Riddler
and Catwoman too!
The sum of the angles
of that rectangle is monstrous.
We've been given warning.
They work to take over--
-Gotham City?
-Any two of them might try that!
-The whole country?
-lf it were three, l'd say yes.
But four?
Their minimum objective must be...
...the entire world.
CATWOMAN:
The United World building, comrades.
Our objective, the Security Council.
Sitting like fat birds in a tree
just waiting to be snatched.
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!
Passing porpoises
which intercept torpedoes!
There ought to be
a piscatorial statute!
Time is short! We've got
to get Batman before he gets us.
I could lure him into
a giant exploding octopus--
After one of your fishy explosions,
they're still in one piece.
I suppose they'll be broken up
by your moldy jokes!
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.
We'll play each of our treacherous
trumps in one hand.
And we'll do it right here!
-How?
-How?
The end.
The end of....
We shall spring them from
the Joker's jack-in-the-box...
...through that window,
out over the sea...
...and into the waiting arms
of the Penguin's exploding octopus!
The trigger? One of my riddles.
And the bait? You, Catwoman.
You're mad.
The minute Batman spots her...
...he'll bop her with a Batarang.
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.
And as Kitka, she shall lure
some millionaire into a kidnap trap.
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.
-Batman will race to the rescue.
-Capital!
But who are we going to kidnap?
I know the perfect victim.
I know the perfect victim! l know!
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head...
...of that disgusting do-gooding
Wayne Foundation.
Delicious! Just the sort of square
citizen Batman will dash to rescue.
-Then snap!
-lnto the combination trap.
Perfect, Riddler, perfect.
Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya
Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.
I'm from The Moscow Bugle.
My friends call me Kitka.
Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym.
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.
The Wayne Foundation is known
from Leningrad to Kamchatka.
It works for peace and understanding.
Your picture has appeared
countless times in The Moscow Bugle.
I'm most grateful,
I wasn't aware of that.
Oh, da, da.
You found these riddles on Wayne
Foundation stationery under your door?
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That's why I brought them to you.
I thought it was some foolishness,
then l remembered:
Is there not
a bourgeois criminal cad...
...the Riddler,
who preys upon the workers?
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.
But there is such a creature.
What do we do now? Report
these riddles to your police...
...or perhaps
to that Cossack Batman?
That's hardly necessary at the moment.
Doubtless it's the work
of some harmless crank.
Nevertheless, shall we give
this matter further consideration...
...over dinner tonight?
What a perfectly lovely idea.
I'll telephone to cancel
a previous engagement.
Alfred will see you to the door.
Do vechera.
Do vechera, Comrade Wayne.
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency.
Very good, sir.
Listen to these riddles.
Tell me if you interpret them as l do.
-"What has yellow skin and writes?"
-A ballpoint banana.
Right. "What people are
always in a hurry?"
Rushing people? Russians!
Right again.
What would you say they mean?
Banana, Russian....
A Russian will slip on a banana peel
and break their neck!
Precisely, the only possible meaning.
-A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
-Who?
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian
journalist for The Moscow Bugle.
In some way she must have unwittingly
stumbled on the criminals' plot!
What is the scheme?
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out
on the town with Miss Kitka.
-A not displeasing chore.
-lndeed.
I've rarely met a girl...
...who's a potent argument
in favor of international relations.
You will dog our footsteps
in the Batmobile.
You'll keep watch via the Batscanner.
-lf the Riddler tries to make good--
-l'll bash him brutally.
-Then we close in with the police.
-Yes.
-Got your driver's license?
-ln my wallet.
Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.
[SINGS IN FRENCH]
This curtain which separates
our countries is so foolish.
If we could just contrive...
...some way of getting more
deeply involved with each other.
Da, we must search for such a method.
[WHlSPERS]
It's wrong to listen to this.
Some things have to be private,
even for a crime fighter.
Your discretion is admirable,
Master Robin, yes.
-Time for another check-in.
-Roger.
[BEEPlNG]
-Commissioner.
-Yes?
-Yes, Boy Wonder.
-Batmobile position:
Gotham Park,
proceeding south on West Drive.
About to pass
Benedict Arnold monument.
Still in the park? lt's been
almost an hour. What are they doing?
No comment, commissioner. Let's just
say, no sign of criminal activity.
Yes, l understand.
I've just thought of a clever ruse.
Have Chief O'Hara
flash the Batsignal.
If you say so, but why?
The crooks will think
we're racing to headquarters.
Thinking we're out of the way,
they might strike at Miss Kitka!
Devilishly clever!
-Thank you. Batmobile over and out.
-Right.
-Chief O'Hara, flash the Batsignal.
-Yes, sir.
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?
BRUCE:
Incredible, I don't--
-Of course! How clever.
-Clever, Comrade Wayne?
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.
It's the Batsignal,
from the roof of police headquarters.
Batman must be racing
there in response.
Then you did get the police
to call them in for my protection.
Yes, yes.
How perfectly wonderful of you!
I close my eyes and l dream
of those savage Cossacks...
...racing over the steps
on their mission.
How strange.
I close my eyes,
and l dream of something...
...quite astonishingly different.
Da, da.
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.
The dream continues.
[BEEPlNG IN MORSE CODE]
-lt approaches a climax.
-Nyet.
Not so fast. Be more slow.
Miss Kitka?
May I see you home
to that penthouse apartment?
-He swallowed the Catbait!
-And now to make him Batbait.
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch,
the jetpack umbrellas!
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
I'll slip into something
more comfortable...
...while your cocoa is warming.
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.
I don't know about prudent.
But it's the only decent thing to do.
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
There it is, 73rd Street
and Concord Avenue.
Follow me down to the terrace.
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
[SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN]
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.
"To One in Paradise," first stanza.
About that dream you had....
-Do we dare?
-Why not?
Yes, of course. Why not?
Of what use is a dream if not
a blueprint for courageous action?
Into action, comrade.
Miss Kitka,
I have the strangest feeling...
...that l am about to be utterly
and madly carried away.
[CRASHlNG]
-This is a kidnapping!
-Our joke's on you!
You filthy criminals!
[HlSSES]
-Much as one deplores indiscretion--
-Right.
I'll just take one tiny, tiny peek.
-Holy demolition!
-Bless my dustpan!
Cover the exits.
I'll race up with my Batrope!
Holy Halloween!
[HOWLS]
Strange, Batman should've
been here hours ago.
Maybe you didn't leave
a clear enough clue.
I did! l can't understand why
Batman hasn't dashed into our trap.
He puts his foot here,
my secret jack-in-the-box fires...
...shooting him over the sea...
...into the waiting arms
of Penguin's exploding octopus.
What a deliciously
humorous trajectory!
And nothing
to link us with the crime.
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?
She's quite well, Mr. Wayne.
I swear by heaven,
if you've harmed that girl...
...l'll kill you all.
I'll rend you limb from limb!
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka...
...or l'll wreck this place
with my dying breath!
Blindfold the captive.
Lead him down the labyrinthine path
to chamber 1 7.
Two minutes, no more.
-Turn on the secret microphone.
-Quiet, quiet!
-Miss Kitka.
-Comrade Wayne.
-Are you all right?
-Da, da.
I'll curse myself forever.
This nasty soup we're in
is of my brewing.
If l hadn't let your beauty
lull me off guard....
Off guard, comrade?
There are some things
I cannot disclose.
But we're in the hands
of the most vicious foursome.
I fear we have nothing
to look forward to but death.
It may not be that black,
Comrade Wayne.
Batman and Robin are
probably hot on our trail.
From something
I happened to overhear...
...l think we are merely
bait for Batman.
Once he's in their trap,
we'll be released.
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.
You do not think
Batman will get here?
That I cannot say.
Did you overhear any mention...
...of any other prisoner
of this rotten gang?
No, I did not.
Who on earth could you mean?
[BELL RINGS]
Commodore Schmidlapp
ringing for his tea.
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.
A moment, while l think....
Why didn't l think of it sooner?
[BELL RINGS]
Of what?
Up my sleeve I have a radio
transmitter strapped above my elbow.
-What a curious device to carry.
-Not at all.
Capitalists who carry a lot of money
have safety contrivances.
If l can just get at it....
Wiggle around back-to-back.
Maybe you can reach it
with your fingers.
Da.
Let's get him.
There we are.
You think you're pretty clever,
don't you?
-Clever enough to outwit you.
-We'll see about that.
Dear colleagues, let's see
what's strapped above his left elbow.
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you'd been listening in!
I told you that fish story
about a radio....
Get him!
Miss Kitka! Where are you?
-Great day!
-Hello, commissioner.
Dick, we're late for
that demonstration. Excuse us.
But you can't dash off now.
How did you escape?
-With the aid of Batman.
-Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.
My fine finkish friends, you have
heard my astounding proposal.
What do you say?
What do you say?!
Our strike cannot be postponed.
We're at the mercy
of the Gotham River tide.
It's now or never
to get through the channel.
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.
So, to the Penguin's princely plan.
Is it yes or no?
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.
Would you drop one of your dream pills
into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?
-Presto!
-Then carry him to the submarine!
Mr. Riddler,
will you tell Mr. Quetch...
...to fetch the five guinea pigs?
-Fetch the guinea pigs.
-Yo-ho.
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Now, my fine fishy finks...
...you see the commodore's
pice de "no-rsistance"...
...an instant whiskey maker.
Waiting for us to put it
to more universal use.
Don't be afraid.
You'll feel nothing.
I am merely going
to temporarily extract...
...every bit of moisture
from your bodies!
It's a painless operation.
-Delightful!
-Dehydrated!
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan...
...and put every one of them
very carefully into separate vials?
Mr. Riddler, would you prepare
the submarine to get underway...
...while l prepare a terrifying
demolition charge for the police?
-Where do we meet?
-United World building.
Gotham River.
39th floor. The elevator.
-One hour?
-One hour.
What criminal genius, Catwoman!
Who but a genius could conceive
such an audacious plot?
To trick Batman and Robin into
inviting me to their Batcave...
...with five dehydrated
death-dealing pirates at my command.
Careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.
With people in weird outfits
like the supercrooks around here...
...it's amazing no one reports
this place to the police!
It's a low neighborhood,
full of rum pots.
They attribute curious sights
to alcoholic delusions.
Gosh, drink is sure a filthy thing.
I'd rather be dead than unable
to trust my own eyes.
Yes, honey. There was someone
walking up the wall.
Ready with super-blinding Batpellets.
-Away, Robin. Away!
-But--
Come on, Batman.
Batman!
Miss Kitka!
[BAND PLAYS]
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives! lnto the street!
Some days you just can't
get rid of a bomb.
[BOMB EXPLODES]
Batman.
Batman!
-lt's all right.
-Holy heart failure!
I was able to dispose
of that bomb just in time...
...and shield myself
behind these heavy iron pipes.
You risked your life to save
that riffraff in the bar?
They may be drinkers,
but they're also human beings...
...and may be salvaged.
I had to do it!
But we lost the trail of that angelic
Miss Kitka. Stranded without a clue!
Ahoy there! Could you chaps
direct me to a policeman?
Commodore Schmidlapp's the name.
Big Ben Distilleries, you know.
-Holy costume party. The Penguin!
-Obviously.
What's his game?
-What's your game, Penguin?
-Penguin?
No, my name's Schmidlapp,
old boy, Schmidlapp.
Your fingerprints will
settle that hash.
We'll check them against our mobile
anti-crime file in our Batmobile.
Let's see your hands.
Looks like plastic-coated fingertips!
Yes, l scorched myself
pressing a waistcoat.
I do believe the attending
surgeon did use plastic, yes.
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaloed.
Not quite.
There's one method of identification
no one can evade.
Retinal eye patterns?
He's right. The pattern
of blood vessels...
...in the retina,
as individual as a fingerprint.
Don't you have an anti-criminal,
eye-pattern master file...
...in your Batcave?
Why don't you take me there?
-You'll submit yourself to a test?
-lt might be an amusing experience.
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'll give him the Batgas.
What? Batgas?
An anesthetic, necessary
to prevent you from seeing...
...the entrance to the Batcave.
If anyone knew that, they could
pierce the secret of our identities.
Ready, commodore?
Oh, l say, what deucedly strange
customs you colonials have!
Well, l'm ready.
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.
-Why did he let us take him?
-We'll soon know.
-l've got the eye checker.
-Stay on alert.
After l give him the Batwake,
we must be ready for anything.
Oh, it's you.
We're here, eh? l see.
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!
I must say, your laboratory
exceeds the limits...
...of man's wildest imagination.
Could l trouble you
for a glass of water?
Your Batgas has left me
with a parched sensation.
The water dispenser is clearly marked.
All right, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.
You'll have worse than a parched
sensation when we're through.
Perhaps, perhaps. But l am
appalled by your attitude, sir.
Condemning me before the facts have
been authoritatively established!
You are abrogating
my constitutional rights, sir.
ROBlN:
All set.
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.
ROBlN:
Holy hallucination!
I wish it were, but it's five
dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Attack them, you faltering fink!
They're gone! Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...
...couldn't have foreseen their
rehydration with the heavy water...
...we use to recharge
the atomic pile!
It left them in an unstable condition!
You saw it yourself. The slightest
impact was sufficient...
...to instantly reduce them
to antimatter.
Antimatter?
You mean, they won't be coming back?
No, Robin. Not in this universe.
Let that be a lesson in the dangers...
...of tampering with the laws
of Mother Nature.
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.
-You have?
-You were duped. Brainwashed.
The criminals planted
those dehydrated thugs on you.
You were obviously
under the influence...
...of post-hypnotic suggestion
when you rehydrated them.
Come on down, commodore.
Another sniff of Batgas,
and we'll all return to the city.
Are you sure you didn't
hurt your head?
Perfectly. Swallow this pill.
Now, give our friend here
a whiff of Batwake.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
Manifold pressure's dropping.
We'd better stop and check it.
-Sorry about that. Won't take long.
-Yes, you will!
Yo-ho and away we go in my Birdmobile!
One side kick for a sailor.
-You okay?
-Thanks to the anti-Penguin gas pill!
He's played right into our hands.
Via Batcycle to the Batcopter!
We'll track him
to the gang's new hideout.
Disengage go-cart.
Batscanner tracking
the stolen Batmobile.
Port two degrees,
then steady as she goes!
Yo-ho, port two degrees!
We're almost there!
-Where are you going?
-To fire off more riddling clues.
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.
That miserable, waddling
mountebank of a bird!
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!
Say Penguin failed. All the more
reason not to hand them clues.
But l must! Outwitting Batman
is my sole delight...
...my joy, my heaven on earth,
my very paradise.
Riddler, come back!
Stolen Batmobile turning,
heading up Gotham River Drive.
Polaris-type missile
coming right for us!
Hold on! This may be tricky.
-Damage?
-The tail rotor's disengaged.
Brace yourself, Robin,
we're going down.
This could be the end.
Now, to find my riddling
Polaris skywriter!
Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo!
I got them. I got them.
Holy horseshoe!
Some luck, landing right on top
of a bed of foam rubber!
The odds against it would make even
the most reckless gambler cringe.
True, I did think l'd spotted it
out of the corner of my eye, but--
That crazy missile wrote
two more riddles before it blew up.
An egg!
Make applesauce.
Apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.
A unification in a container of hope?
United World Organization!
Precisely!
And the Security Council meets today.
-lf what l fear is true--
-Let's commandeer a taxi.
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.
It'll be faster if we run. Let's go!
We are now passing
through the grotto.
-Depth, half a fathom.
-Engines, dead slow astern.
Dead slow astern.
[MEOWS]
As the blueprint said,
an abandoned construction elevator.
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.
[MEOWS]
-l hope Penguin made it.
-Who needs him?
Stand back.
Hey! Can't you read?
A fine day for penguins.
My co-conspirators,
we meet as planned.
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo
has been silenced forever.
Blasted out of the sky
by a coincidence!
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler's Polaris skywriter.
Happy happenstance! Hold your
breaths as we cross the hall.
There are still lingering traces
of my finely filtered Penguin gas.
Holy marathon! l'm getting a stitch!
Let's hope it's a stitch in time
that saves nine.
The nine members
of the Security Council.
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES]
It is the opinion of Her Majesty
that we pursue peace at all costs.
Our poor united world in microcosm.
I'm afraid they'll find our humor
very, very dry.
We understand your position,
but for peace--
It has always been our policy--
Quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.
And, boys, don't anybody sneeze.
BATMAN: Seal the building!
ROBlN: Close the ventilating system!
The Security Council
may have been dehydrated!
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.
Emergency, operator, emergency!
Up, up, up, up!
-Surrender! You criminals!
-The United Underworld is through!
What's this, an apparition?
One false move, and you'll find out.
We'll hurl our Batarangs!
-To the elevator!
-Catwoman! Stop, l said!
I don't think you mean that.
Miss Kitka dies
if you take one more step! Go!
This way, Robin!
The Security Council, gone!
What a fiendishly clever way
to abduct nine men...
...from a heavily guarded building!
Where does that elevator go?
Downstairs, to an abandoned
submarine dock on the river.
Holy Captain Nemo! They'll head
for sea by way of Short lsland Sound.
We have just one trump card left.
Heaven help the world if we fail.
Come on!
Down periscope.
We're over the last bar.
Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead.
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!
What a delightful haul!
Mr. Riddler, will you prepare
those nine radio ransom messages?
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.
One billion dollars cash,
from each country.
Precisely! To be delivered
to our secret island...
...by the horde of trained carrier
pigeons which I shall provide.
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!
Make those messages clear!
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sonar contact.
Range 8000. Bearing 1 81 .
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
Small craft at 7500, bearing 01 .
Small craft?
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.
-The Batboat!
-Drat that cockleshell!
Mr. Bluebeard,
steady on the diving planes.
I'll man the torpedo tubes.
Would you fire a surface-to-surface
underwater homing missile?
[MEOWS]
Missile ahoy!
It has a homing device in
its nose cone. Take evasive action.
No use. lt's tracking us!
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.
That class of missile receives
on a wavelength of 1 64.1 .
-1 64.1 .
-Quickly! Send a jamming signal.
It's starting down.
Farewell, Batman!
Farewell, Dynamic Duo!
Holy bikini, that was close!
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000. Bearing 88.
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!
MAN:
Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.
-Range 3500.
-Get the Batcharge launcher.
Roger!
They hold nine of the world's most
eminent men in dehydrated condition.
Our task is not to sink that sub,
merely to drive it to the surface.
Forward torpedo tubes,
prepare to fire.
Yo-ho! Forward torpedo tubes,
prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two...
...torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes away!
-Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
-Yo-ho, dive.
Down periscope.
Torpedo off the port bow!
Prepare to fire Batcharges
in front of torpedoes.
That's too soon!
It must be Batcharges!
And that means there'll be more
of the dread things meant for us!
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!
Shut up, you feline floozy!
Mr. Bluebeard, down 30 fathoms.
Run silent, run deep.
They're diving, silent engines.
I'll circle them at full-thrust speed,
diminishing radius of curvature.
Roger.
What's their bearing?
-l don't know, sir.
-You don't know?
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.
Fire when ready.
I'll maintain curvature.
Yo-ho! Compartments A, B and C
taking in water, sir!
Penguin, you know l can't take water!
You cowardly kitten,
you want to live forever?
-This bird has flown around the bend!
-To cuckooland!
Oh, Riddler, Joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Blow all tanks! Surface! Surface!
Cut the Batcharges.
They've had enough, l imagine.
They're surfacing fast.
-Estimated surfacing position?
-200 yards.
Here they come.
Diminishing speed. Ready to board.
Roger.
Pirates! To arms!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Strike your colors!
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!
Bon voyage, pussy.
Holy heartbreak! Miss Kitka!
[WOMAN SlNGS IN FRENCH]
Batman, I....
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.
Of course.
It's just one of those things
in the life of every crime fighter.
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.
Batman to coast guard.
There's a submarine
two miles east of Sandy Nose.
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.
Robin. Over here, look.
The hope of the world,
tottering on the brink!
Holy almost!
To think, it might have been shattered
before our very eyes.
-Up, Catwoman.
-The service here has gone to pot.
What the devil is this?
The captain's costume party?
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.
Increase angstrom force in vector X.
Vector X up one notch.
[BEEPlNG]
-Yes, commissioner?
-What progress? ls there hope?
There's always hope.
But do you think you and Robin
can separate that mingled dust...
...back into its constituent members?
With all modesty, commissioner...
...if we can't, heaven knows who can.
Truer words were never spoken.
PRESIDENT: Howdy, you all.
How are those boys doing up there?
Batman says there's hope,
Mr. President. What more can one ask?
The free world is waiting. Tell Batman
I salute him and wish him luck.
I needn't tell you
with whom l have just spoken.
Ready for separation.
All right.
I'll activate the computer link.
Input the ethnic and national factors.
-Batman, wait a minute!
-What?
Well, with the way
the world is and all...
...maybe we ought to try
to improve those factors?
-Reshuffle them a little.
-No.
It's not for us to tamper
with the laws of nature.
In this very Batcave,
you saw a ghastly example...
...of what happens
when one tries to do that.
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way....
Here we go.
[BEEPlNG]
Yes?
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.
Separation accomplished.
They are ready to rehydrate.
We are ready to rehydrate.

Who knows, Robin?
This strange mixing of minds...
...may be the greatest single service
ever performed for humanity.
Let's go, but inconspicuously.
Through the window.
We'll use our Batropes.
Our job is finished.

Alert the queen.
Hyah!
Bruce Vayne.
Bruce Wayne.
Talk.
I believe there is a stranger.
Comes to this village
from the sea.
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.
He brings fish.
He comes on the king tide.
That was last night.
You have eyes, so see.
Icebergs in the harbor.
It's four months since
the last ship got through.
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.
There are enemies
coming from far away.
I need warriors.
This stranger, others like him.
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.
It's very important
that I see this man.
If this stranger exists,
he'll give him your message.
$5,000 American.
Look, I'll give you $25,000
to talk to this man
right now, outside.
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.
Ooh, magical man from the sea.
We are poor, not stupid.
Get out.
I'm sorry.
Can't do that.
I'll leave after we've spoken.
He said, "Get out."
Arthur Curry.
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.
The Aquaman.
So, let me
get this straight.
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.
Oh, that shithole.
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.
Is that why you do this?
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?
I've read the stories.
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.
You'll join us.
"Strong man
is strongest alone."
You ever heard that?
You ever hear
of Superman?
He died fighting next to me.
My point exactly.
He believed
we were stronger together.
We owe it to him.
I don't owe anyone anything.
Dressed like a bat.
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.
Move over, Dusty.
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.
Costa Rica's nice.
I found him.
He said no.
So the draft stands
at naught for two?
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?
That's $10, please.
Good morning, Miss Lane.
Jerry, hi.
Wow.
You don't miss a day, do you?
Like it here.
Excuse me.
Move!
Move it! Move it!
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!
Get the fuck over there!
Move! All of ya!
Line them up
along the wall.
Keep them quiet.
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!
Shut them up too!
We'll be making
a statement shortly.
Until then,
if I see any movement,
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.
Should I take him?
Hold your fire.
They've got kids in there.
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.
Quiet! Shut up!
Down with the modern world.
Back to the Dark Ages.
Quiet!
I said shut your fucking mouth.
Who are you?
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.
Now, who are you?
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?
We have no demands.
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.
While you do what?
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...
...while the world watches.
No!
Like lambs
to the slaughter.
I don't believe it.
Believe it.
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?
Good. It's okay.
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.
It's all good.
It's over now.
Are you okay?
You okay? Good.
Are you okay, princess?
Can I be like you someday?
You can be anything
you want to be.
Come on. Let's go.
Any changes today?
No, my Queen.
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.
It has slept
for thousands of years
since the First Age.
Why did it wake at all?
This is the first time
it's gone quiet
since the crack appeared.
Maybe it's going back to sleep.
Evil does not sleep.
It waits.
Something is coming.
Prepare for battle!
Amazons,
on your marks!
Ready!
Defenders.
They have failed 100,000 worlds.
They always fail.
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.
I will bathe in your fear.
Daughters of Themyscira,
show him your fear!
We have no fear!
Gather the legions!
Go with her!
You must seal the cage!
- Go!
- Phillipus!
No!
Behind you!
Ahhh!
Epione.
Honor us. It's right.
Seal it.
Ready the hammers!
Seal it now!
Guard it with your life.
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Got it! Go!
Hyah!
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?
You can't save her.
You can't save any of them.
The great darkness begins.
Amazons!
Yes, we will find the others.
Draw!
Loose!
He's gone back to his universe.
No.
He's gone to the lands of men
to find the other two boxes.
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.
Men won't know what it means.
Men won't.
She will.
It's toxic.
That's good.
Go!
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.
Find the missing two.
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.
This world will join the others.
He will be pleased.
He will see my worth again.
Hey.
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?
Possibly.
"Possibly."
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,
our disappearing man.
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.
Might be another false positive,
you'll have to give me
a little time
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.
Master Wayne,
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow
to build this team
of people you can't even find.
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.
Just because Lex Luthor says
the planet's
in danger of attack?
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.
It has to do with him.
I made a promise to him
on his grave.
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.
I need to bring us together
and make this right.
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.
Maybe they're already here.
Keep looking.
What else do you have?
Lab's all yours, Howard.
11:30.
Early night for you, Silas.
Yes, early night.
Tell your family I said hello.
What the...
Jesus.
The Arrow of Artemis.
It will reach the lands of men.

hero beacon,

Burn as you burned
in days before.
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.
Warn my daughter
that war has come
and protect her.
Return to me, Diana.
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?
Nothing very interesting.
That's all you ever tell us.
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.
Again?
- What is it?
- Now what?
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.
Now add to the list "arson."
Yes, good morning
from the isle of Crete.
As you can see behind me,
an enormous bonfire is burning.
This fire has been burning
through the night.
We're now into the morning
and we are
at least five miles away.
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.
This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike
here at this historical site
of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to
- what may have caused this.
- Invasion.
Ryan.
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...
No damage to the electron-laser.
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?
They took whatever was in here.
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.
What's your rank, Doctor?
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.
We work for the DoD.
We advise them on xeno-science.
"Xeno-science"?
Alien technology.
For example,
the Superman ship.
Eight people
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.
Cleaning staff, guards,
a few of
your research scientists.
They were abducted.
Are you sure?
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.
Any idea who
or what that might be?
The box isn't safe here.
Victor,
they came looking for it
at the lab.
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.
You know a lot about monsters,
don't you?
Especially how to make 'em.
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.
Mayday!
Is there anybody out there?
Ahh!
Whiskey.
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.
It's on him.
King who would be man.
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.
All the time I've wasted
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.
Are you finished,
old man?
You never sleep
in the same place twice,
yet you keep coming back here.
I like it. It's quiet.
It's your inheritance.
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.
Our people suffer.
Your people.
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.
Is the surface any different?
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.
What do you want, Vulko?
Guards near
the stronghold
have been disappearing.
Snatchers from above.
Talk to King Orm.
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.
He lies.
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.
They're looking for it.
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.
Protect the box.
The time has come.
Take up your mother's trident.
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.
Above or below.
DeSaad.
DeSaad! I call to thee.
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?
This world is divided.
They are a primitive species.
Unevolved and at war
with one another.
Too separate to be one.
Their free will
must be ripped from them,
like the other worlds.
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,
to serve him.
The Mother Boxes?
I have found one of the three.
The one that woke
and called to me.
The other two still sleep,
but the parademons
feel their presence.
They fly,
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.
Yes.
Mighty Steppenwolf,
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.
But undone by his self-pride.
DeSaad...
I fall before you.
Let me make a plea to him
that I may come home
after I take this world
in his name.
You betrayed him.
Your own family.
I saw my mistake.
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.
He will hear your plea
when you pay your debt.
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.
No protectors here.
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.
This world will fall,
like all the others.
For Darkseid.
For Darkseid.
You know,
I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.
You got
your money's worth.
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.
Hi there.
A new toy?
Prototype troop carrier.
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace
couldn't make it fly.
But you can?
I have no choice.
I need more range
and I need more cargo.
I think
there's an attack coming.
Not coming, Bruce.
It's already here.
From what I've learned,
they are things
from another universe.
They serve a dark power.
An old power.
What do they want?
To invade.
To conquer.
They came here once before,
long ago.
A great armada
appeared in the sky,
laying waste
to all who opposed it.
The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.
Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.
The old gods, men...
Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement
and guardians from the stars.
Their histories
had taught them
not to trust each other,
not to hope for an alliance.
To fight apart.
As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,
he found a secret there.
A power hidden
in the infinity of space.
He called forth mystics
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...
the Mother Boxes.
Wait, wait, wait.
"Mother Boxes"?
Indestructible living machines,
made from a science so advanced,
it looks like sorcery.
To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize
and join together
into The Unity.
The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.
All who live
become servants of Darkseid.
Alive but drained of life.
Parademons.
Amazons!
With me!
But before The Unity
could synchronize,
the defenders of Earth attacked
and fought as one.
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.
Zeus and his son Ares
alongside the guardians
from the sky.
A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together
to defend life on Earth.
They did what no world
had ever done.
Sent the enemies
back into the stars.
The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.
The Unity never came to pass.
But, in their retreat,
the boxes were left behind
on Earth.
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters
falling asleep,
awaiting their return.
Fading from the view
of the enemy,
anonymous
among a trillion worlds.
The defenders of Earth
made a vow.
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.
Each would enshrine and guard
one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture
in case a box
should ever wake again
to call out
to the planet Apokolips
to return and conquer
the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.
Something woke the box
my people guard.
It called out
to the dark place...
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.
The enemy is here.
If he's here, where is he?
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.
No, it will.
It has to.
The others.
Where are they?
Am I late?
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.
Oh. No.
Okay, bye. Okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm late.
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,
then the bus did come,
but then there was
this old woman
counting change for the fare,
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.
She's 107 years old,
these are some of her
last few moments of life.
Resume.
Resume.
Come on.
Come on.
From the French, of course.
"Resume," I believe,
is a past participle of...
Uh, wow. That's no good.
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.
Yes.
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.
You said you had experience
walking dogs.
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,
I always bring a meat snack.
'Cause it makes them feel calm.
'Cause you never know what's
going to happen in this city.
I mean, oh, my gosh.
Right? I start on Monday?
You have been near a Mother Box.
The scent is on you.
Where is it?
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box
for thousands of years.
I will never betray
my own people.
You already have.
This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.
He must be an Atlantean.
A water-breather.
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.
Mixed-blood, then.
He said he'll fight with us?
More or less.
More more or more less?
Probably more less.
- He said no?
- He said no.
Atlanteans
can be tricky.
My people went to war
with them once.
I'm not sure we can trust him.
Diana, if we're gonna do this,
you're gonna need to be open
to more things that we didn't...
you know...
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.
Don't worry about it.
- Let's...
- It happens.
so...
This is the
third person.
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.
One frame of video, see?
Barry Allen. Central City.
Go to him.
I'll work on number four.
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.
He's a cyborg.
- Ready!
- Break!
Three...
eighty...
set... go!
Your son may be captain
of the football team
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...
Dr. Stone.
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system
to change his friend's grades.
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.
How could that child
pass her classes?
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.
What did you do to help her?
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.
He got held up at the lab.
Okay. He always does.
He wanted to be here.
You always say that.
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...
I know he's proud of you.
We both are, Victor.
Hey, hey, hey.
With everything I know
you can do today,
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.
Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,
your wife didn't survive.
I'm afraid
your son won't either.
I won't let you die.
I won't allow it.
I won't allow it.
Victor.
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.
You still have a life
ahead of you.
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.
If you were there,
Mom would still be alive.
All right, look,
you don't have to give me
a second chance,
but give yourself one.
If you can't stand
looking at me,
try listening.
What you can do now, Victor.
Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.
The tip of the tip.
In the world
of ones and zeroes,
you are the absolute master.
No firewall can stop you.
No encryption can defy you.
We're all at your mercy, Vic.
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,
everyone's lives are controlled
and dominated
by complex digital networks
that will bend
without effort to your will.
The fate of the world
will literally
rest in your hands.
Its entire nuclear arsenal,
you could launch with a thought.
The world's monetary systems
and its complex interactions
will seem as easy
to manipulate for you
as a child's plaything.
The question...
No, the challenge
won't be doing it.
It will be not doing.
Not seeing.
It is the burden
of this responsibility
that will define you
and who you choose to be.
Now, make a wish.
One more time.
Good job. Wave to Grandma!
Hi, Grandma!
What?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Victor...
Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.
That's how I've been
speaking to you.
Now,
let me speak to
you from my heart, not as a scientist,
as a father.
Hey.
Hey, you!
Because you are
holding yourself back.
You're going in circles, man.
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,
going on four.
Where do you even find the time?
I make the time.
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.
You can't.
Like I always said
I would.
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?
Yeah.
For what?
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,
who's still in prison
for the murder
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?
I can't remember.
Oh, boy.
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.
Give me your hand, man.
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.
I want you to give all that up.
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.
I am a drag on your life.
Okay. Um...
Please don't ever
say that to me again.
Please.
Hey, you know what
criminal justice
would be for me?
My son not wasting his life.
You can be
whatever you wanna be.
You're brilliant, man.
Absolute best of the best.
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City
for some old dude
who's not going anywhere.
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.
That's not true.
Let's go, Allen. Allen!
I want you
to make your own future.
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.
Open gate.
Great.
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."
Clear.
Close the gate.
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.
You said that like it explains
why there's a total stranger
in my place
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.
Tell me about this.
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,
but who is definitely not me.
Somebody... I don't know.
Hippie, long hair.
Very attractive Jewish boy.
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.
I know you have abilities.
I just don't know what they are.
My special skills
include viola, web design,
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.
It's what they use
on the space shuttle
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.
I do very competitive
ice dancing.
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,
but whoever you're looking for,
it's not me.
You're the Batman?
So, you're fast.
That feels
like an oversimplification.
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.
Stop right there. I'm in.
You are?
Just like that?
Yeah.
I need friends.
Great. Great.
Can I keep this?
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.
I call it the Speed Force.
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.
I am a snack hole.
How many people are
on this special fight team?
- Three, including you.
- Three?
Against what?
I'll tell you on the plane.
Plane?
What are your superpowers again?
I'm rich.
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.
Would you like
to have some?
Uh, no, thank you.
If you put the water in first.
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.
- Yes.
- Great.
No, that's probably enough tea.
All right.
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.
I will.
I will, definitely will.
Uh... What are you working on?
It's a gauntlet
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.
Oh, maybe you should, uh...
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.
Of course.
Ah.
Ah, now, let's see how that did.
Ha! Yes.
Not to be sneezed at.
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.
It's Master Wayne's idea.
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?
- In black, of course.
- Oh.
All right. Victor Stone.
Something is not working.
Mmm.
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?
You know who I am.
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.
The world does.
Fuck the world.
You've obviously
been through a great deal.
I can't begin to imagine what.
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.
Gifts?
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?
We need you, Victor.
And maybe you need us.
I don't need anyone.
Not anymore.
I told myself the same
for a long time.
I lost someone I loved once.
I shut myself off from everyone.
But I had to learn
to open back up again.
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.
And if you asked to meet me...
you're working on it, too.
You were right
about the metal sample
from the Superman ship.
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,
look what happens.
3.5 million kelvin.
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.
Hot, dense matter.
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.
Exact words I said
to my prom date.
She dumped me anyway.
Yeah.
Hey, Doc,
do you think Batman is connected
to the object
the CID is looking for?
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?
No...
I don't.
Oh, Victor.
All right! Let's go!
Commissioner Gordon?
Come on!
Your messages.
Hey, hey!
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.
What's wrong with dental school?
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."
On a possibly related note,
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions
at the lab across the harbor.
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?
I'll talk to him tonight.
How, Jim?
How do you think?
Silas?
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?
His name is Victor.
We met, spoke.
Give him time.
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.
Oh!
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.
That means we have to go now.
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.
Commander Mera, I told the king
the perimeter guards were taken.
He won't send reinforcements.
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.
All right, take what men
we have left
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.
You can't escape.
I'm not trying to.
Vulko told me
you would come.
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.
Wait.
Please.
I knew her.
Well, that makes one of us.
My parents died in the wars.
She took me in.
What a saint.
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep
and never gave me
another thought.
Your mother left you
to save your life.
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.
What it cost her.
But you're not
a defenseless child now.
It would have been
her responsibility
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.
Now,
it's yours.
Yes.
Steppenwolf,
tell me what you've learned.
Two boxes
found and awake.
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.
Where is the third Mother Box?
The parademons
sense its presence
and search for the third.
They have taken prisoners
who carry its scent.
Go.
Interrogate the prisoners.
Find the third.
They will tell me
what they know,
or I will rip it from them.
How many of you are there?
Not enough.
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.
Description matches the suspect
in the Metropolis abductions.
Parademons.
Okay.
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.
At the lab.
They carried people away
to find out what they know.
So the eight may still be alive.
Nine.
Oh.
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.
So, how do we find him?
There must be a nest nearby.
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.
No discernable pattern
I can see.
The lines on the map
don't converge.
On land.
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,
between the two cities.
These are air vents.
They all lead down to the tunnel
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.
The nest could be there.
Uh,
is he coming with us now,
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.
I have something bigger.
Do you really think that...
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?
Oh. That's rude.
We're close.
The scent of the enemy.
Of absence.
Darkness.
Death.
Where are we, Alfred?
Stryker's Island.
You should be directly under
the venting tower
for the tunnel.
Now look to your left,
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.
That's it.
Let's go.
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?
Either of you?
Don't engage alone.
We do this together.
I heard about you.
Didn't think you were real.
I'm real when it's useful.
I grow tired of your silence.
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?
Please. We have families.
Then you have weakness.
Steppenwolf.
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.
Good guess.
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.
Circle to the other side.
We'll surround them
and surprise him.
You have been near a Mother Box.
The scent is on you.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!
He... He doesn't know.
Wait, please, please!
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.
I will die before I tell you.
You'll die if you don't.
No!
Victor.
Kill them both.
Ah, Amazon.
But not like your sisters.
Stronger.
Amazon.
Hold!
This one will be mine.
I belong to no one.
Guys, this is not together.
Help get those people
out of here.
I'll make sure these things
follow me.
Everybody, move!
A little quicker.
- Are you good?
- Yeah.
I've got this. Keep moving.
This way.
The energy
is dissipating.
My gauntlet worked!
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.
Thought you'd never ask.
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.
Thank you, Alfred.
Don't mention it.
No!
Whew.
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.
My turn.
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.
Are you all right, Master Wayne?
Are you all right?
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.
You okay?
Mm.
Wasn't sure you'd come.
You're my father.
Go.
No!
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.
Uh, do I know you?
What are we under, right now?
Gotham Harbor.
Who is that?
Come on.
Diana, get on!
What is it?
Show me.
It is here.
On this world.
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine
for possible alien microbes.
U.S. government protocols
require that...
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.
It called to him.
The Mother Box.
The one he already has.
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.
If he doesn't already have it.
He doesn't have it.
I do.
Have you finished the conquest?
Not yet, DeSaad.
Then why do you summon me?
I bring news.
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.
The Anti-Life Equation.
The key to controlling all life
and all will
throughout the multiverse.
He found it hidden on a
primitive planet, but before...
The story of the defiance
is well-known.
I have found
the primitive planet.
The world that fought back.
It is Earth.
The Anti-Life Equation is carved
into the surface
of this very world.
Are you certain?
I have seen it.
I have looked with my own eyes.
Anti-Life.
My lord.
Oh, Steppenwolf.
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.
Can it be true
that you have found it?
I have, great one.
The lost world is Earth.
Anti-Life is here.
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,
synchronize The Unity, and
when this world is scorched,
I will come for my great prize.
You will come to Earth?
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust
looking for Anti-Life.
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.
I will stride across their bones
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.
And all of existence
shall be mine.
It shall be so, my master.
So cool.
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.
It wants to fly.
You talk to machines?
I speak
to intelligence.
This one's saying she can't fly
because of a software issue,
but I could fix it
with a little time.
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.
I could feel
the other two boxes.
I know they're awake,
but I can't see where they are.
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.
Even if we knew,
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.
Maybe one.
Hmm, Superman.
As long as
the third box is asleep,
they can't see it,
only sense it.
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.
No. That's just a strategy
to lose more slowly, not to win.
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?
Why don't we just destroy it?
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.
They're an unknown form
of matter.
Oh, they love heat.
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.
Makes you think.
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?
Are you trying to say something?
Oh, I'm saying it.
How do we know you're not
working for them?
It's a long story.
You got somewhere else to be?
The Nazis found the box
at the end
of the Second World War,
buried under
an Italian monastery.
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.
They brought it back
to the States in '44.
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives
for 70 years
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection
between the ship...
and 6-1-9-8-2.
He understood they were
both alien technologies.
Different civilizations,
similar properties.
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.
And so did.
Then...
I had an accident
that should've killed me.
But in an act of desperation
or madness,
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.
He unleashed an alien technology
he didn't fully understand.
He used that power
to keep me alive.
Alive...
but turned into this.
The box went back to sleep
and he never returned it.
That researcher was Silas Stone.
My father.
Wait,
your father saved your life
with one of these things?
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?
They're change machines.
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,
alive or dead.
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,
regenerate, reinstate.
Reinstate?
A box has the power
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter
can't be created or destroyed,
their relations just transform.
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.
But a Mother Box...
...turns smoke
back into a house.
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.
Who is it?
Martha.
Hi.
Hi.
I went to the Daily Planet
to finally pick up
Clark's things.
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.
I lost the farm.
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.
Truth is, the house is too big
for me to live in
by myself anyway.
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time
for as long as you need.
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,
right by the diner.
I'm not here for help.
I'm here because
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.
I can't.
The whole world is mourning.
Grieving over a symbol.
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."
I hear what people say.
They talk like they knew him.
But they didn't know Clark.
And I can't stop them
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.
You're the only one who knows.
Who feels what I do.
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.
I came all this way
because I wanted...
because I wanted to see you.
Tell you...
I understand.
I...
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.
And I just miss him.
I miss him so much.
So do I, sweetheart.
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.
There is something
you can do for me, honey.
Come back to the living.
The world needs you, too, Lois.
The dead are dead.
The box brought Victor back.
Victor wasn't dead.
Life is either one or zero.
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.
Can you operate this box,
Victor?
Of course.
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.
Okay, but...
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.
What do we have to lose?
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.
As soon as it wakes up...
...the enemy sees it, comes,
activates The Unity.
The end.
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet
to a bunch of genocidal
aliens. That's good to know.
Even if Superman could return,
who's to say
that he could defeat them?
The Mother Box did.
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.
None of the boxes did.
Not until...
Not until Superman died.
Not until Superman died.
It's like they were
afraid of him?
Yes,
they were afraid of him.
This is the only way.
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.
Cross this one off
the bucket list.
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?
We could.
He was my hero.
All right.
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.
Half-Atlantean.
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.
Hate is useless.
Yep.
No, thank you.
You know, my father told me
there's a saying in Atlantis...
"None are taken back
from the darkness.
"Not without..."
"Not without
giving one up in return."
We say the same thing.
How about that?
Wonder Woman.
What do you think, man?
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.
Every guy's a younger guy.
Jesus.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, bloody...
Any luck?
If by "luck" you mean
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"
then, no. No luck.
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body
to the Kryptonian ship.
It's basically
an organic computer.
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?
Something like that.
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?
Master Wayne...
you did it!
You put the team together
to fight this war.
You've fulfilled your promise.
But to try to do that...
I mean...
your guilt's
overcome your reason.
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,
not on reason.
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.
How do you know
your team's strong enough?
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,
then don't wave
the red cape at it.
You do when it's this red cape.
This red cape charges back.
Okay.
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.
Everyone's clear, including you.
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?
Absolutely.
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.
If you need
more medical attention...
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.
Or... "B"?
Let me see "A" again?
Right. We should get dressed.
I'm always dressed.
ID?
ID.
Aye, aye.
"Aye, aye"?
Okay.
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!
Doc!
They let you out of quarantine.
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made
with the electron-laser.
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.
Victor, clear this place out.
Done.
Code Red.
Contamination breach.
All personnel
evacuate immediately.
Bio red five.
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's gotta be a false alarm.
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!
Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.
Attention, all personnel.
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!
Move! Come on! Go, go!
Everybody out! Go!
Yes! Gotcha!
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?
- Go ahead, Dr. Stone.
- This is a false alarm.
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...
Victor.
Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.
I was mistaken.
The alarm's legit.
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.
Roger that, sir.
Get the civilians out!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.
- Everybody?
- Yes.
This way.
It knows he's here.
Ooh, that's intense.
This is amazing.
This is crazy.
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.
Systems coming online.
Welcome, Victor.
Would you like
to assume command?
I'm in.
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.
I can override
the security protocols,
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage
that Luthor's
power surges caused
to the primary capacitors.
English.
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.
I might be able to do it.
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.
I don't like to break this rule,
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...
Look, crazy things
happen to time,
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...
still what we want?
It is. Do it.
Hey, Miss Lane.
Morning.
I didn't think you were coming.
One last time.
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...
I'm in position.
Ready to initiate
drop sequence.
The Mother Box is ready.
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.
This action
is irreversible.
It's afraid. It knows
Steppenwolf will come for it.
We know that already.
Continue.
I strongly advise
against activation.
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.
This action
is irreversible.
- Five...
- Five...
- Five...
- Apokoliptian technology
- is hostile.
- This is a bad idea.
No, it isn't.
Keep going.
Four...
- Four...
- Four...
I strongly advise
against activation.
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.
- Three...
- Three...
Three...
- Two...
- Two...
- Two...
- This course is irreversible.
- One.
- One.
One.
This action
is irreversible.
- Victor?
- No.
Go?
The future
has taken root in the present.
Get down!
He's back.
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.
What?
Victor?
Victor?
- Shit.
- What are you doing?
It's my auto-defense system.
It senses danger.
Victor, no! Victor!
- I can't control it.
- Don't!
Kal-El, no!
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.
Arthur, we need to restrain him.
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...
remember who you are.
Tell me who you...
Let's go!
You should probably move.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.
Please don't make me do this.
Clark.
Clark, no.
Clark.
No.
This world needs you.
Clark.
Clark.
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Clark.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Just go.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
Take cover!
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.
Where is it?
Come on.
Come on.
Attention,
security breach detected.
Sector Four, Level Three.
Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.
Give me the Mother Box.
No, no, no.
Dad, wait! Don't!
So begins the end.
Victor?
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.
Victor?
He's dead.
What?
My father.
I didn't save him. I couldn't.
Oh, my God.
His father's dead 'cause of us.
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.
It wasn't a bad idea.
We needed Superman.
We still do.
Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.
It is him.
He recognized Lois Lane.
- Who?
- The woman he loves.
- He remembers her.
- Nah.
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.
It's called instinct, Diana.
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?
He's gone back to his base
to assemble the three boxes.
And we don't know
where his base is.
- Or how long until...
- Hours.
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.
This is not your...
He knew.
He knew, he knew, he knew.
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...
he was trying to superheat it.
He made the core
the hottest thing
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.
Now, anything that hot
would have to...
Blink off the charts
on a thermal imaging system.
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.
I'm already on it.
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?
I have six.
Right.
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.
You brought us here.
You remembered.
This is home.
You spoke.
Did I not before?
Your mother got behind
on the payments.
She never told anyone.
I don't understand.
She's a proud woman, Clark.
Here.
She loved it here.
So did I.
So did I.
Wow!
This is awesome.
Brought some friends.
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.
Oh...
It's badass, Alfred.
Well, I'll put on the tea.
Great.
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.
There's the
Mother Box, right there.
Go to visible spectrum.
Pozharnov.
Ghost city not far from Moscow.
It's been abandoned since
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.
Not even the army goes in.
Right, it's probably
so radioactive
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.
Not anymore.
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.
Zoom.
What the hell is he building?
The Unity's in there.
We'll attack from above.
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,
only strengthen their bond.
What?
So we can't blow it up?
Not from the outside.
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.
Fuse with it.
Weaken its bond from the inside
so we can break it back
into three.
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.
These boxes together
are world destroyers.
A billion years old.
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.
Just get me in and get me time.
You could die, Victor.
If I don't, we all die.
Period.
I got nothing left.
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?
That's what I'm gonna do.
Okay. So...
if Victor wants
to try to save the world
by fusing with the doom boxes,
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.
But getting him in
means attacking that base.
Fighting the devil and his army
in hell.
I mean,
this guy's probably fought
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?
And we have to assume he's won.
I don't care
how many demons he's fought
in how many hells...
he's never fought us.
Not us united.
Take that as a "yes."
What?
The ring.
You're really back.
I have a second chance, Lo.
And I am not gonna waste it.
Are you really you?
I'm really me, Ma.
Listen, Ma.
They wanted me back
for a reason.
I need to find out why.
How's Victor doing?
You know,
wanted to be by himself.
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father
to go up against
the most powerful machines
in the universe.
It's not fair.
I thought you didn't care?
I never said that.
What is it?
Uh...
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,
almost like a premonition.
It was the end of the world
and Barry Allen was right here
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."
She is... to Superman.
Every heart has one.
I think it's something more.
Something darker.
Master Wayne.
Master Wayne!
You need to see this.
You fixed it.
It wanted to fly.
Flight is its nature.
Yours, too.
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.
What makes you so sure?
Faith, Alfred. Faith.
At last.
Prepare for his arrival.
My redemption is nigh.
Unite.
The satellites revealed
he's created a defensive dome.
It's a design flaw.
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think
anyone would be that nuts.
Bruce is right.
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.
What if the dome's
not destroyed?
It'll be destroyed.
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity
with Barry's help,
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.
Remind me,
how's that again?
Uh, with the power of love.
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.
Good.
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted
to generate
a charge of that size.
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.
And, Victor, it's all up to you.
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.
We have a plan.
The symbol
of the house of El means hope.
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief
in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.
Clark...
That's what
you can bring them.
...you were
sent here for a reason.
You will give
the people of Earth
an ideal to strive towards.
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,
you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.
They will stumble,
they will fall.
You're gonna
have to make a choice.
They will join you
in the sun, Kal.
A choice
of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race
or not.
You will help them
accomplish wonders.
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.
I'm so proud of you, son.
Your mother and I
loved you.
Your mother and I knew
you would change the world.
Your heart was tested.
I know
it's been hard, Clark.
But you gave hope
to their world.
You need
to show them who you are.
Love them, Kal.
The way we loved you.
Fly, son.
It's time.
I'm gonna take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.
Whatever you see,
stick to the plan.
It's why I brought you together.
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.
Just have to knock
a little louder.
Kill him!
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.
Oh, shit.
The tower's down.
Do you read me?
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.
Are you okay?
Bruce? Bruce?
Get to the reactor.
I'll lure as many
of these monsters
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.
They're here.
Bruce?
Comm went dead.
Let's go.
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.
Critical damage.
You really are outta your mind.
You're welcome.
My man.
Yeah, we got this.
You go do your thing.
I'm assuming you're Alfred.
Master Kent.
He said you'd come.
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.
Hey!
Remember me?
Round two?
Hell yeah.
Shall we?
Tell me, Amazon,
why did you
abandon your own sisters
only to cast your lot
with these creatures
clinging to their puny lives?
You weren't there
to protect them from me.
And, sadly, you could have.
Barry, I'm in position.
Okay.
I built the charge.
You call it.
Barry, on one.
Three, two...
Get the hell off me!
Victor!
Victor!
I watched your island burn,
your sisters
begging for their lives.
As did your mother.
Liar.
I can't maintain this!
Victor!
Victor, I can't hold this!
For Darkseid.
Not impressed.
All right.
Kal-El.
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.
I need the charge to get inside.
Barry?
Barry, are you okay?
Barry!
I got the wind
knocked out of me.
Need a few seconds, that's all!
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.
Heal. Heal.
Barry!
It's too late.
Oh, no.
He's here!
Okay.
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.
Far beyond the speed of light.
You gotta break the rule, Barry,
and you gotta do it now.
Dad...
whatever happens,
I want you to know
your kid was one of them, Dad.
One of the best of the best.
Make your own future.
Make your own past.
It's all right now.
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.
My broken boy.
You don't have to be
alone anymore.
We'll be together again.
we can put it back, Vic.
Make you whole again.
I'm not broken.
And I'm not alone.
Superman!
I told you
Steppenwolf would fail.
Yes. Yes, you did.
My master,
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,
how will you retrieve
your great prize?
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.
Ready the armada.
We will use the old ways.
Your father twice over.
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,
not as a scientist,
as a father.
Your father twice over.
I brought you into the world
and back to it.
You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.
Have always been.
So many years with you I wasted.
So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.
Everything breaks, Victor.
Everything changes.
I gotta go see my father.
The world is hurt.
Broken.
Unexchangeable.
Ship's all yours now, kid.
You're the boss.
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."
That's your thing.
Uh, yep.
That's my thing.
But the world's
not fixed in the past,
only the future.
The not yet. The now.
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.
Must be.
Big round table.
Six chairs, right there.
But room for more.
But room for more.
God help us.
The now is you.
What?
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.
But, uh, my foot's in the door.
This is like a "job" job?
"Job" job.
Your foot's in the door.
Isn't that a thing people say?
Your foot's in the door.
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.
His foot's in the door!
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.
Taught him nothing he knows.
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna
get maced again.
No stopping you now.
Thanks, Dad.
Now.
Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.
How did you get the house
back from the bank?
I bought the bank.
Congratulations, by the way.
Do this. Be this.
The man I never was.
The hero you are.
Take your place
among the brave ones.
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.
It's time you stand,
fight,
discover,
heal, love,
win.
The time
is now.
Ready?
Come on, Stevens.
All right,
let's keep it moving.
Keep going.
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.
Luthor.
Open up two, Carl, please.
Luthor.
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.
Ah, there he is.
Welcome aboard.
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?
I was just celebrating
God's return.
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.
I was, thank you,
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me
find some much needed clarity.
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat
free of charge.
Why the pro bono work?
It's personal.
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?
You said you had something
I'd want?
You'd better not be
wasting my time.
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?
No, I wouldn't think of it.
Uh, I have too much to live for.
And more important things to do.
But if you want the Batman,
here is something
that can help you.
His name is Bruce Wayne.
Hmm. On second thought,
we do have something
to celebrate.
Good boy.
Clear.
How much further?
We're almost there.
Well, we need to hurry.
We can't be out in the open
much longer.
He'll come for us.
Let him come.
Let the bastard come.
I'll stab this through his heart
for what he did to Arthur.
I want to make him pay.
I understand how you feel, Mera.
You have no idea how I feel.
But we have to stick to the plan
to have any chance
to make this right.
Who have you ever loved?
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.
He knows exactly what it's like
to lose someone he loves.
You know, like, uh,
a father,
like a mother.
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.
Like an adopted son.
Isn't that right,
Batman?
Maybe, in a way,
that smelly
old flounder is right.
Because how many
can die in your arms
before you grow numb to death?
That's not very careful.
And how many dead eyes
can you look into
before you die inside yourself?
I've been dead inside
a long time,
but even I have a limit.
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?
You won't kill me.
I'm your best friend.
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?
Anyway,
you need me.
You
need me to help you
undo this world
you created by letting her die.
Poor Lois.
How she suffered so!
I often wonder
how many alternate timelines
do you destroy
the world because...
frankly, you don't have
the cojones to die yourself.
Hmm?
So, as usual,
I'll be the bigger man.
A truce,
Bruce.
As long as you
have this card, a truce.
But all you have to do
is tear it in half
and I'm happy
to discuss with you
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder
to do a man's job?
You know, it's funny
that you would talk about people
who died in my arms
because when I held Harley Quinn
and she was bleeding and dying,
she begged me
with her last breath
that when I killed you,
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...
that I'd do it slow.
I'm gonna honor that promise.
Oh. You're good.
You almost had me.
Where are we holing up?
Somewhere he'll never suspect.
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?
What do you think?
He's found us.
Can I help you?
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.
We have to find it
before he does.
There's a war coming.
And I'm here to help.
I'm sorry, who are you again?
I've gone by many names
and taken many forms.
And like you,
I've realized I have
a stake in this world
and it's time
I started fighting for it.
Oh.
Well, we could
definitely use the help.
So, glad you're here.
You know, I never thought
I'd see the defenders of Earth
united and fighting as one.
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.
Your mother and father
would be proud.
I hope so.
Well, I'll be in touch.
Oh, and some have called me
the Martian Manhunter.
I guess I'll see you around.
in your castle...
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.
Selina Kyle.
You're fired.
And Bruce Wayne...
...why are you dressed up like Batman?
Because he is Batman, you moron!
Was.
Don't.
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?
One way to find out.
Four.
Five.
Still alive!
Six.
Seven.
All good girls go to heaven.
Two lives left.
I'll save one for next Christmas.
But in the meantime...
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?
Shit!
I picked a cute one.
The heat's getting to me.
I'll murder you momentarily.
But first...
...I need a cool drink...
...of ice water.
Stop the car.
Come what may...
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Merry Christmas, Alfred.
Goodwill toward men.
And women.
